abstract = {Procedures used to detect environmental impacts that occur as a result of planned disturbances are often inadequate. Widely used designs for univariate measures, such as the abundance of a population, lack proper spatial replication and have unjustified patterns of temporal sampling. Asymmetrical analyses of variance derived from repeated measures models can be used to detect many types of impact that are not identifiable using widely recommended BACI (Before/After, Control/Impact) sampling. These asymmetrical, beyond BACI designs are also more logical because of spatial replication. The mechanics of these procedures are discussed, including worked examples of calculations, considerations of their power to detect impacts of a specified magnitude and the integration of various temporal and spatial scales into the design. Related issues are briefly discussed concerning optimization of sampling and how to proceed when no data are available before a disturbance.},

abstract = {Objective: Setting up clinical reports within hospital information systems makes it possible to record a variety of clinical presentations. Directed acyclic graphs (Dags) offer a useful way of representing causal relations in clinical problem domains and are at the core of many probabilistic models described in the medical literature, like Bayesian networks. However, medical practitioners are not usually trained to elicit Dag features. Part of the difficulty lies in the application of the concept of direct causality before selecting all the causal variables of interest for a specific patient. We designed an automated interview to tutor medical doctors in the development of Dags to represent their understanding of clinical reports. Methods: Medical notions were analyzed to find patterns in medical reasoning that can be followed by algorithms supporting the elicitation of causal Dags. Clinical relevance was defined to help formulate only relevant questions by driving an expert's attention towards variables causally related to nodes already inserted in the graph. Key procedural features of the proposed interview are described by four algorithms. Results: The automated interview comprises questions on medical notions, phrased in medical terms. The first elicitation session produces questions concerning the patient's chief complaints and the outcomes related to diseases serving as diagnostic hypotheses, their observable manifestations and risk factors. The second session focuses on questions that refine the initial causal paths by considering syndromes, dysfunctions, pathogenic anomalies, biases and effect modifiers. A case study concerning a gastro-enterological problem and one dealing with an infected patient illustrate the output produced by the algorithms, depending on the answers provided by the doctor. Conclusions: The proposed elicitation framework is characterized by strong consistency with medical background and by a progressive introduction of relevant medical topics. Revision and testing of the subjectively elicited Dag is performed by matching the collected answers with the evidence included in accepted sources of biomedical knowledge. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Floury2013,
abstract = {Aquatic species living in running waters are widely acknowledged to be vulnerable to climate-induced, thermal and hydrological fluctuations. Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions are most likely to occur in a multiple-stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30 years (1979-2008) in the Middle Loire River, France. As observed in other large European rivers, water warming over the three decades (+0.9 Â°C between 1979-1988 and 1999-2008) and to a lesser extent discharge reduction (-80 m(3) s(-1) ) were significantly involved in the disappearance or decrease in taxa typical from fast running, cold waters (e.g. Chloroperlidae and Potamanthidae). They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e.g. Corbicula sp. and Atyaephyra desmarestii). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i.e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution-sensitive taxa (e.g. the caddisfly Brachycentridae and Philopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects.},

@article{Schmutz2015,
abstract = {European rivers are highly degraded and restoration efforts are becoming more frequent. However, only few restoration projects have been rigorously evaluated so far. We investigated the response of fish assemblages to hydromorphological restoration measures including river widening, creation of instream structures, flow enhancement, remeandering and side-channel reconnection. We sampled 15 rivers with pairs of degraded and restored sites and calculated the effect sizes (i.e., restoredâdegraded) for species richness, species diversity, fish density and habitat traits. We analysed the following factors potentially affecting restoration success: (1) length of the restored river stretch, (2) time after restoration and (3) hydromorphological quality of restoration. While species diversity and density did not respond to restoration, proportion of small rheophilic fish increased and eurytopic decreased. Short-term ({\textless}3 years) and long-term effects ({\textgreater}12 years) of restoration measures have a stronger effect on fish assemblages than mid-term effects. Furthermore, the hydromorphological quality and the length of the restored section are relevant for the restoration effects on the fish community. Future restoration projects should focus on more dynamic, self-sustaining habitat improvements extending over several kilometres and should be coupled with other measures such as restoring the river continuity and species reintroductions.},

@article{Richards1997,
abstract = {1. We used catchment and reach-scale physical properties to predict the occurrence of specific species life history and behaviour traits of aquatic insects across fifty-eight catchments in a mixed land use basin. Catchment-scale attributes were derived using a geographical information system (GIS). Logistic regression techniques were used to model the relationships. 2. The reach-scale properties were highly predictive of species traits. Fourteen of the fifteen traits had significant models with concordance values greater than 68{\%}. Cross-sectional area at bank full discharge, {\%} shallow, slow-water habitats, and {\%} fines were the most important variables. 3. Life history and behavioural attributes were best related to reach-scale physical features. This suggests that species traits exhibit strong relationships to local environmental conditions. 4. Catchment-scale variables had fewer significant models with species traits (four of fifteen), however these variables may have direct or indirect influence on reach-scale properties. 5. Catchment features, in particular surficial geology, influence macroinvertebrate assemblages through their control over channel morphology and hydrologic patterns. 6. The effects of land use were masked by geology (i.e. lacustrine clay geology and rowcrop agriculture were correlated), lack of detail in land use data and the aggregation of the species data. 7. These models reflect the coupling of local environmental conditions and the set of adaptations among the local taxa. These observations underscore the idea that habitat plays a major role in organizing stream assemblages. 8. Using these approaches, predictions can be made about the ability of various taxonomic groupings to track environmental change through time, or for projecting the impact of alternative land management scenarios. Identifying fundamental life history and other traits can improve the selection and evaluation of such indicators.},

abstract = {The scientific research literature is reviewed (i) for evidence of how much reduction in nonpoint source pollution can be achieved by installing buffers on crop land, (ii) to summarize important factors that can affect this response, and (iii) to identify remaining major information gaps that limit our ability to make probable estimates. This review is intended to clarify the current scientific foundation of the USDA and similar buffer programs designed in part for water pollution abatement and to highlight important research needs. At this time, research reports are lacking that quantify a change in pollutant amounts (concentration and/or load) in streams or lakes in response to converting portions of cropped land to buffers. Most evidence that such a change should occur is indirect, coming from site-scale studies of individual functions of buffers that act to retain pollutants from runoff: (1) reduce surface runoff from fields, (2) filter surface runoff from fields, (3) filter groundwater runoff from fields, (4) reduce bank erosion, and (5) filter stream water. The term filter is used here to encompass the range of specific processes that act to reduce pollutant amounts in runoff flow. A consensus of experimental research on functions of buffers clearly shows that they can substantially limit sediment runoff from fields, retain sediment and sediment-bound pollutants from surface runoff, and remove nitrate N from groundwater runoff. Less certain is the magnitude of these functions compared to the cultivated crop condition that buffers would replace within the context of buffer installation programs. Other evidence suggests that buffer installation can substantially reduce bank erosion sources of sediment under certain circumstances. Studies have yet to address the degree to which buffer installation can enhance channel processes that remove pollutants from stream flow. Mathematical models offer an alternative way to develop estimates for water quality changes in response to buffer installation. Numerous site conditions and buffer design factors have been identified that can determine the magnitude of each buffer function. Accurate models must be able to account for and integrate these functions and factors over whole watersheds. At this time, only pollutant runoff and surface filtration functions have been modeled to this extent. Capability is increasing as research data is produced, models become more comprehensive, and new techniques provide means to describe variable conditions across watersheds. A great deal of professional judgment is still required to extrapolate current knowledge of buffer functions into broadly accurate estimates of water pollution abatement in response to buffer installation on crop land. Much important research remains to be done to improve this capability. The greatest need is to produce direct quantitative evidence of this response. Such data would confirm the hypothesis and enable direct testing of watershed-scale prediction models as they become available. Further study of individual pollution control functions is also needed, particularly to generate comparative evidence for how much they can be manipulated through buffer installation and management.},

abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) have proven to be popular models for decision-theoretic planning, but standard dynamic programming algorithms for solving MDPs rely on explicit, state-based specifications and computations. To alleviate the combinatorial problems associated with such methods, we propose new representational and computational techniques for MDPs that exploit certain types of problem structure. We use dynamic Bayesian networks (with decision trees representing the local families of conditional probability distributions) to represent stochastic actions in an MDP, together with a decision-tree representation of rewards. Based on this representation, we develop versions of standard dynamic programming algorithms that directly manipulate decision-tree representations of policies and value functions. This generally obviates the need for state-by-state computation, aggregating states at the leaves of these trees and requiring computations only for each aggregate state. The key to these algorithms is a decision-theoretic generalization of classic regression analysis, in which we determine the features relevant to predicting expected value. We demonstrate the method empirically on several planning problems, showing significant savings for certain types of domains. We also identify certain classes of problems for which this technique fails to perform well and suggest extensions and related ideas that may prove useful in such circumstances. We also briefly describe an approximation scheme based on this approach.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is the causative agent of Johne's disease, a chronic enteritis in ruminants including cattle, sheep, goats, and farmed deer. Recently, this bacterium has received an increasingly wide interest because of a rapidly growing body of scientific evidence which suggests that human infection with this microorganism may be causing some, and possibly all, cases of Crohn's disease. Recent studies have shown that a high percentage of people with Crohn's disease are infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis; whether the association of this bacterium and Crohn's disease is causal or coincidental is not known. Crohn's disease is a gastrointestinal disease in humans with similar histopathological findings to those observed in the paucibacillary form of Johne's disease in cattle. The search for risk factors in Crohn's disease has been frustrating. However, epidemiologists have gathered enough information that points to an association between M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease. This paper reviews epidemiological models of disease causation, the major philosophical doctrines about causation, the established epidemiological criteria for causation, and the currently known epidemiological evidence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis as a possible cause of Crohn's disease.},

abstract = {Agricultural pesticides continue to impair surface water ecosystems, although there are few assessments of interactions with other modifications such as fine sediment and physical alteration for flood drainage. We, therefore, surveyed pesticide contamination and macroinvertebrates in 14 streams along a gradient of expected pesticide exposure using a paired-reach approach to differentiate effects between physically modified and less modified sites. Apparent pesticides effects on the relative abundance of SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) were increased at sites with degraded habitats primarily due to the absence of species with specific preferences for hard substrates. Our findings highlight the importance of physical habitat degradation in the assessment and mitigation of pesticide risk in agricultural streams.},

abstract = {Data on phytoplankton, macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish from more than 2000 lakes in 22 European countries were used to develop and test metrics for assessing the ecological status of European lakes as required by the Water Framework Directive. The strongest and most sensitive of the 11 metrics responding to eutrophication pressure were phytoplankton chlorophyll a, a taxonomic composition trophic index and a functional traits index, the macrophyte intercalibration taxonomic composition metric and a Nordic lake fish index. Intermediate response was found for a cyanobacterial bloom intensity index (Cyano), the Ellenberg macrophyte index and a multimetric index for benthic invertebrates. The latter also responded to hydromorphological pressure. The metrics provide information on primary and secondary impacts of eutrophication in the pelagic and the littoral zone of lakes. Several of these metrics were used as common metrics in the intercalibration of national assessment systems or have been incorporated directly into the national systems. New biological metrics have been developed to assess hydromorphological pressures, based on aquatic macrophyte responses to water level fluctuations, and on macroinvertebrate responses to morphological modifications of lake shorelines. These metrics thus enable the quantification of biological impacts of hydromorphological pressures in lakes.},

abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (WFD), which was adopted in 2000, changed water management in all member states of the European Union fundamentally, putting aquatic ecology at the base of management decisions. Here we review the successes and problems encountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10years and provide recommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address three fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring programmes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, monitoring and success of restoration measures). The development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in improved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process has been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. Future challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results and a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality Elements. A huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring data are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future challenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central monitoring network of reference sites. The WFD river basin management plans base management decisions on the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic response to restoration is less well-known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD (obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future challenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the requirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-colonisation potential.},

abstract = {When native grassland catchments are converted to pasture, the main effects on stream physicochemistry are usually related to increased nutrient concentrations and fine-sediment input. We predicted that increasing nutrient concentrations would produce a subsidy-stress response (where several ecological metrics first increase and then decrease at higher concentrations) and that increasing sediment cover of the streambed would produce a linear decline in stream health. We predicted that the net effect of agricultural development, estimated as percentage pastoral land cover, would have a nonlinear subsidy-stress or threshold pattern. In our suite of 21 New Zealand streams, epilithic algal biomass and invertebrate density and biomass were higher in catchments with a higher proportion of pastoral land cover, responding mainly to increased nutrient concentration. Invertebrate species richness had a linear, negative relationship with fine-sediment cover but was unrelated to nutrients or pastoral land cover. In accord with our predictions, several invertebrate stream health metrics (Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera density and richness, New Zealand Macroinvertebrate Community Index, and percent abundance of noninsect taxa) had nonlinear relationships with pastoral land cover and nutrients. Most invertebrate health metrics usually had linear negative relationships with fine-sediment cover. In this region, stream health, as indicated by macroinvertebrates, primarily followed a subsidy-stress pattern with increasing pastoral development; management of these streams should focus on limiting development beyond the point where negative effects are seen.},

abstract = {1. The structure of lotic macroinvertebrate communities may be strongly influenced by land-use practices within catchments. However, the relative magnitude of influence on the benthos may depend upon the spatial arrangement of different land uses in the catchment.2. We examined the influence of land-cover patterns on in-stream physico-chernical features and macroinvertebrate assemblages in nine southern Appalachian headwater basins characterized by a mixture of land-use practices. Using a geographical information system (GIS)/remote sensing approach, we quantified land-cover at five spatial scales; the entire catchment, the riparian corridor, and three riparian 'sub-corridors' extending 200, 1000 and 2000 m upstream of sampling reaches.3. Stream water chemistry was generally related to features at the catchment scale. Conversely, stream temperature and substratum characteristics were strongly influenced by land-cover patterns at the riparian corridor and sub-corridor scales.4. Macroinvertebrate assemblage structure was quantified using the slope of rank-abundance plots, and further described using diversity and evenness indices. Taxon richness ranged from 24 to 54 among sites, and the analysis of rank-abundance curves defined three distinct groups with high, medium and low diversity. In general, other macroinvertebrate indices were in accord with rank-abundance groups, with richness and evenness decreasing among sites with maximum stream temperature.5. Macroinvertebrate indices were most closely related to land-cover patterns evaluated at the 200 m sub-corridor scale, suggesting that local, streamside development effectively alters assemblage structure.6. Results suggest that differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure can be explained by land-cover patterns when appropriate spatial scales are employed. In addition, the influence of riparian forest patches on in-stream habitat features (e.g. the thermal regime) may be critical to the distribution of many taxa in headwater streams draining catchments with mixed land-use practices.},

abstract = {This paper presents the CBNB (Causal Bayesian Networks Building) algorithm for the causal Bayesian Network construction. This algorithm is designed for diagnosis models in the industrial domain. It uses expert knowledge and operates process and product traceability data. The first phase of this algorithm consists of exploiting expert knowledge and properties of the application domain for allocating the variables at different levels of causality. This phase results in a cascade arrangement of the system's variables starting with the root causes and ending with the ultimate effects passing through one or more intermediate levels. In the second phase based on the unitary traceability data, the CBNB algorithm then allows to determine the causal relationships existing between variables. We provide the necessary assumptions and the theoretical justifications for the proposed algorithm. We have conducted empirical studies assessing the ability of the algorithm to provide the true network from synthetic data on three benchmarks whose nodes are arranged in cascade. The results of comparative analysis have shown that the CBNB algorithm outperforms GS and MMHC, two state-of-the art structural learning algorithms in terms of ability to rebuild the true network.},

Recent studies have disagreed about the relative importance of catchment versus local characteristics in explaining variation in fish assemblages. Our synthesis indicates that both riparian- and catchment-scale land use explained significant variation in water quality, channel morphology, and fish distribution and density. Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages can be positively affected by increasing the extent of perennial riparian and upland vegetation. Our synthesis is robust; more than 425 stream reaches were examined in an area that includes a portion of three ecoregions. Fishes ranged from coldwater to warmwater adapted. We suggest that efforts to rehabilitate stream system form and function over the long term should focus on increasing perennial vegetation in both riparian areas and uplands and on managing vegetation in large, contiguous blocks.},

Four streams in pastoral, scrubland, exotic pine plantation forest (primarily Pinus spp.), and native beech forest (Nothofagus spp.) catchments were sampled in four seasons. Alkalinity, pH, and calcium concentrations were highest among scrubland streams, whereas iron and potassium concentrations were highest in pastoral streams. Both taxonomic richness and invertebrate biomass were greatest in the beech forest streams where most species of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera were found. Forest streams were dominated by the mayflies Deleatidium and Coloburiscus humeralis, the stonefly Stenoperla prasina, and the caddisfly Olinga feredayi. The facultative shredder Austroperla cyrene was also abundant in pine forest streams. However, mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly taxa were poorly represented in pastoral streams. In contrast, molluscs were most prolific in pastoral streams, where the hydrobiid snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum dominated and the chironomid Eukiefferiella sp. was also abundant. Streams in the four land use types represented a series of progressively more modified systems, ranging from pristine beech forested streams to highly modified streams draining agriculturally developed catchments. The structure of the stream communities changed along this ''ecological gradient''.},

Since the prevalence of the pathogens and infections are determined by many site-by-site factors, which are not compliant with conventional approaches for approximate reasoning, we introduce fuzzy information.

abstract = {One misconception (of many) about Bayesian analyses is that prior distributions introduce assumptions that are more questionable than assumptions made by frequentist methods; yet the assumptions in priors can be more reasonable than the assumptions implicit in standard frequentist models. Another misconception is that Bayesian methods are computationally difficult and require special software. But perfectly adequate Bayesian analyses can be carried out with common software for frequentist analysis. Under a wide range of priors, the accuracy of these approximations is just as good as the frequentist accuracy of the software--and more than adequate for the inaccurate observational studies found in health and social sciences. An easy way to do Bayesian analyses is via inverse-variance (information) weighted averaging of the prior with the frequentist estimate. A more general method expresses the prior distributions in the form of prior data or 'data equivalents', which are then entered in the analysis as a new data stratum. That form reveals the strength of the prior judgements being introduced and may lead to tempering of those judgements. It is argued that a criterion for scientific acceptability of a prior distribution is that it be expressible as prior data, so that the strength of prior assumptions can be gauged by how much data they represent.},

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are a popular tool in natural resource management but are limited when dealing with ecological assemblage data and when discretizing continuous variables. We present a method that addresses these challenges using a BN model developed for the Upper Murrumbidgee River Catchment (south-eastern Australia). A selection process was conducted to choose the taxa from the whole macroinvertebrate assemblage that were incorporated in the BN as endpoints. Furthermore, two different approaches to the discretization of continuous predictor variables for the BN were compared. One approach used Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) which estimates the thresholds based on the biological community. The other approach used was the expert opinion. The TITAN-based discretizations provided comparable predictions to expert opinion-based discretizations but in combining statistical rigor and ecological relevance, offer a novel and objective approach to the discretization. The TITAN-based method may be used together with expert opinion.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that multiple drivers of ecological change will interact synergistically to accelerate biodiversity loss. However, the prevalence and magnitude of these interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future ecological change. We address this uncertainty by performing a meta-analysis of 112 published factorial experiments that evaluated the impacts of multiple stressors on animal mortality in freshwater, marine and terrestrial communities. We found that, on average, mortalities from the combined action of two stressors were not synergistic and this result was consistent across studies investigating different stressors, study organisms and life-history stages. Furthermore, only one-third of relevant experiments displayed truly synergistic effects, which does not support the prevailing ecological paradigm that synergies are rampant. However, in more than three-quarters of relevant experiments, the outcome of multiple stressor interactions was non-additive (i.e. synergies or antagonisms), suggesting that ecological surprises may be more common than simple additive effects.},

abstract = {1. The provision of environmental flows and the removal of barriers to water flow are high priorities for restoration where changes to flow regimes have caused degradation of riverine ecosystems. Nevertheless, flow regulation is often accompanied by changes in catchment and riparian land-use, which also can have major impacts on river health via local habitat degradation or modification of stream energy regimes. 2. The challenges are determining the relative importance of flow, land-use and other impacts as well as deciding where to focus restoration effort. As a consequence, flow, catchment and riparian restoration efforts are often addressed in isolation. River managers need decision support tools to assess which flow and catchment interventions are most likely to succeed and, importantly, which are cost-effective. 3. Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used as a decision support tool for considering the influence of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystems and the relative benefits of various restoration options. We provide simple illustrative examples of how BNs can address specific river restoration goals and assist with the prioritisation of flow and catchment restoration options. This includes the use of cost and utility functions to assist decision makers in their choice of potential management interventions. 4. A BN approach facilitates the development of conceptual models of likely cause and effect relationships between flow regime, land-use and river conditions and provides an interactive tool to explore the relative benefits of various restoration options. When combined with information on the costs and expected benefits of intervention, one can derive recommendations about the best restoration option to adopt given the network structure and the associated cost and utility functions.},

abstract = {Sound decision making in environmental research and management requires an understanding of causal relationships between stressors and ecological responses. However, demonstrating causeâeffect relationships in natural systems is challenging because of difficulties with natural variability, performing experiments, lack of replication, and the presence of confounding influences. Thus, even the best-designed study may not establish causality. We describe a method that uses evidence available in the extensive published ecological literature to assess support for causeâeffect hypotheses in environmental investigations. Our method, called Eco Evidence, is a form of causal criteria analysisâa technique developed by epidemiologists in the 1960sâ who faced similar difficulties in attributing causation. The Eco Evidence method is an 8-step process in which the user conducts a systematic review of the evidence for one or more causeâeffect hypotheses to assess the level of support for an overall question. In contrast to causal criteria analyses in epidemiology, users of Eco Evidence use a subset of criteriamost relevant to environmental investigations andweight each piece of evidence according to its study design. Stronger studies contribute more to the assessment of causality, but weaker evidence is not discarded. This feature is important because environmental evidence is often scarce. The outputs of the analysis are a guide to the strength of evidence for or against the causeâeffect hypotheses. They strengthen confidence in theconclusions drawnfromthatevidence, butcannotever prove causality. They also indicate situations where knowledge gaps signify insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion. The method is supported by the freely available Eco Evidence software package, which produces a standard report, maximizing the transparency and repeatability of any assessment. Environmental science has lagged behind other disciplines in systematic assessment of evidence to improve research and management. Using the Eco Evidence method, environmental scientists can better use the extensive published literature to guide evidence-based decisions and undertake transparent assessments of ecological cause and effect.},

abstract = {Rigorous and widely applicable indicators of biodiversity are needed to monitor the responses of ecosystems to global change and design effective conservation schemes. Among the potential indicators of biodiversity, those based on the functional traits of species and communities are interesting because they can be generalized to similar habitats and can be assessed by relatively rapid field assessment across eco-regions. Functional traits, however, have as yet been rarely considered in current common monitoring schemes. Moreover, standardized procedures of trait measurement and analyses have almost exclusively been developed for plants but different approaches have been used for different groups of organisms. Here we review approaches using functional traits as biodiversity indicators focussing not on plants as usual but particularly on animal groups that are commonly considered in different biodiversity monitoring schemes (benthic invertebrates, collembolans, above ground insects and birds). Further, we introduce a new framework based on functional traits indices and illustrate it using case studies where the traits of these organisms can help monitoring the response of biodiversity to different land use change drivers. We propose and test standard procedures to integrate different components of functional traits into biodiversity monitoring schemes across trophic levels and disciplines. We suggest that the development of indicators using functional traits could complement, rather than replace, the existent biodiversity monitoring. In this way, the comparison of the effect of land use changes on biodiversity is facilitated and is expected to positively influence conservation management practices.},

@article{Krause2008,
abstract = {In many European lowland rivers and riparian floodplains diffuse nutrient pollution is causing a major risk for the surface waters and groundwater to not achieve a good status as demanded by the European Water Framework Directive. In order to delimit the impact of diffuse nutrient pollution substantial and often controversial changes in landuse and management are under discussion. In this study we investigate the impact of two complex scenarios considering changes in landuse and land management practices on the nitrate loads of a typical lowland stream and the riparian groundwater in the North German Plains. Therefore the impacts of both scenarios on the nitrate dynamics, the attenuation efficiency and the nitrate exchange between groundwater and surface water were investigated for a 998.1 km(2) riparian floodplain of the Lower and Central Havel River and compared with the current conditions. Both scenarios target a substantial improvement of the ecological conditions and the water quality in the research area but promote different typical riparian landscape functions and consider a different grade of economical and legal feasibility of the proposed measures. Scenario 1 focuses on the optimisation of conservation measures for all natural resources of the riparian floodplain, scenario 2 considers measures in order to restore a good status of the water bodies mainly. The IWAN model was setup for the simulation of water balance and nitrate dynamics of the floodplain for a perennial simulation period of the current landuse and management conditions and of the scenario assumptions. The proposed landuse and management changes result in reduced rates of nitrate leaching from the root zone into the riparian groundwater (85{\%} for scenario 1, 43{\%} for scenario 2). The net contributions of nitrate from the floodplain can be reduced substantially for both scenarios. In case of scenario 2 a decrease by 70{\%} can be obtained. For scenario 1 the nitrate exfiltration rates to the river drop even below the infiltration rates from the river, the riparian floodplain in that scenario represents a net sink for river derived nitrate. As the nitrate contributions from the investigated riparian floodplain represent only a small proportion of the total nitrate loads within the river (1{\%} p.a.) the overall impact of the scenario measures on the nitrate loads at the river outlet remains small. However, during the ecologically most sensitive summer periods under current conditions nitrate contributions from the riparian groundwater of the Lower and Central Havel River (which covers only 5{\%} of the area of the Havel catchment) represent more than 20{\%} of the river loads. By the implementation of the investigated landuse changes within the research area the groundwater derived nitrate contributions could be halved to only 10{\%} during summer baseflow conditions.},

abstract = {The occurrence and distribution of macrozoobenthos in estuaries are strongly related to sediment grain-size characteristics. However, statistical prediction of the distribution of benthic populations as a response to a single environmental gradient has proven to be difficult, because the focal variable may set upper limits to the abundance, but other (partly uncorrelated) variables may cause considerable deviation from the maximum. A multi-quantile regression approach is better suited to characterize biota-environment relationships than a single (average or boundary) estimation, because it shows the variation in responses and quantifies the relative importance of other unmeasured factors. Here, a univariate application of non-linear quantile regression is proposed to account for heteroskedasticity and non-linearity in the biological response to sediment grain size. The analysis was applied to a large macrozoobenthic dataset from the SW Delta area (The Netherlands) to compare the relationships between sediment granulometry and macrozoobenthos in 2 neighboring but differing temperate coastal ecosystems (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Preference of individual species for grain size was consistent between both systems, although in general, a slightly higher median grain size (ca. +60{\%} in grain diameter) was preferred in the Oosterschelde than in the Westerschelde. The major difference in the community was, however, that mud-preferring species dominated the assemblage in the Westerschelde, and sand-preferring species dominated the Oosterschelde. Although the prevalence of muddy and sandy sediments in both systems is similar, in the Westerschelde, strong hydrodynamic stress is correlated with sandy habitats, causing impoverishment of assemblages at sandy sites. In the Oosterschelde, sandy sediments are usually associated with much more benign conditions and have the richest species assemblage},

abstract = {A challenge for conservation science is predicting the impacts of co-occurring human activities on ecological systems. Multiple anthropogenic and natural stressors impact ecosystems globally and are expected to jeopardize their ecological functions and the success of conservation and management initiatives. The possibility that two or more stressors interact synergistically is of particular concern, but such nonadditive effects remain largely unidentified in nature. A long-term data set of hard coral cover from Kenyan reefs was used to examine the independent and interactive effects of two stressors: fishing and a temperature anomaly in 1998 that caused mass coral bleaching and mortality. While both stressors decreased coral cover, fishing by 51{\%} and bleaching by 74{\%}, they did not interact synergistically. Instead, their combined effect was antagonistic or weakly additive. The observed nonsynergistic response may be caused by the presence of one dominant stressor, bleaching, and cotolerance of coral taxa to both bleaching and fishing stressors. Consequently, coral bleaching has been the dominant driver of coral loss on Kenyan reefs and while marine reserves offer many benefits to reef ecosystems, they may not provide corals with a refuge from climate change.},

abstract = {The classification of waterbodies under the Water Framework Directive is dependent on the ability of monitoring programmes to reflect habitat quality using biotic elements including benthic diatom communities. This study investigated the influence of specific riparian habitats, of mixed woodland, grassland and lake artificial structures such as jetties and slipways, on benthic diatom assemblages in nine lakes across gradients of total phosphorus, alkalinity and in the presence or absence of Dreissena polymorpha. The heterogeneity of the benthic diatom assemblages at riparian and lake scale was assessed by taking three replicates per site category per lake, following standard European Union protocols. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and mixed effect modelling was used to investigate the main environmental controls on assemblage structure. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was used to examine patterns in assemblage structure. No single environmental gradient was found to control benthic diatom composition, with differences among assemblages influenced both by riparian habitat type within lakes and interaction of multiple environment gradients, including presence of D. polymorpha. Greater control was exerted on community structure at the lake than local riparian scale. The influence of scalar factors on diatom assemblages increased with increasing scale. We recommend that for effective monitoring and assessment of ecological status, standard sampling protocols should include localised littoral habitats with individual samples pooled across riparian habitat types, thereby accounting for both multiple environmental and spatial controls on community structure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Warfe2014,
abstract = {1. The scientific basis for setting environmental flows is still hampered by our incomplete understanding of flow-ecology relationships and how river ecology varies with flow regime. 2. We conducted a study of six rivers in Tasmania (Australia), three perennial and three intermittent, measuring a range of abiotic, biotic and ecosystem process attributes over 2 years. Our intentions were to identify: (i) whether they had an ecology characteristic of their flow regime and (ii) whether certain ecological attributes were more responsive to flow regime than others, and therefore represented candidate indicators (for environmental flows or flow alteration) specific to each flow regime. 3. Only a few abiotic variables showed any relationship with flow regime: banks were higher, pools shallower and sediments finer in perennial rivers, and water temperature was generally lower in perennial rivers. Although rarely measured, we found that productivity and net ecosystem metabolism were strongly related to flow regime, whereas food chain length did not vary between perennial and intermittent rivers. Multivariate, rather than univariate, metrics of biotic assemblages were more effective at distinguishing perennial and intermittent flow regimes, and this was consistent among riparian and instream vegetation, biofilm and macroinvertebrate assemblages. In contrast to expectations from the literature, fish assemblages were not strong indicators of flow regime, largely due to the relatively low diversity and abundance of the Tasmanian fish fauna. 4. Our findings demonstrate that rivers with different flow regimes can support a distinctive ecology, and conventional metrics of ecological character may not be the most sensitive to flow regime. We provide a set of ecological attributes that can: (i) support extrapolation of flow-ecology relationships across rivers to regional scales, (ii) provide benchmarks for environmental flow and flow restoration objectives, (iii) indicate alterations to natural or existing flow regimes and (iv) be used to monitor and evaluate flow management actions. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18â20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95â99{\%} of their muscle and 73â86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that land use has a strong influence on river chemistry and its biotic components. Most of these studies focus on nitrogen in temperate American and European catchments. Much less is known about the relationship between stream conditions and land use in tropical areas of developing countries. Besides climate, there are three important differences between attributes of temperate and tropical catchments: non-point sources are the dominant contributor of pollution in USA, whereas point source pollution is the most important in our study; use of fertilizer is much smaller in developing countries, and the type of agriculture and management practices are distinct. The authors test whether the chemical composition of streams and their macroinvertebrate communities can be related to land use. Accordingly, the variability of chemical composition and macroinvertebrate communities are compared in the streams of two catchments (Pisca and Cabras) belonging to the same ecoregion, but having different types of land use. The main land use in the Pisca catchment in 1993 was sugar cane (62{\%}), followed by pasture (22{\%}) and urban centres (10{\%}). In contrast, the main land use in the Cabras catchment was pasture (60{\%}), followed by annual crops (13{\%}) and forest (10{\%}); urban centres occupied only 2{\%} of the catchment. In the Cabras catchment, most of the parameters correlated with a land use index (LUI). However, only conductivity, major cations and major anions (with the exception of sulfate) had a statistically significant correlation coefficient. More than 90{\%} of the variance was explained for these parameters. DIC, NO sub(3) and richness of invertebrates also strongly correlated with LUI (R super(2) = 0.75), although these correlation coefficients were not significant. Total suspended solids had a significant correlation with LUI (R super(2) = 0.98), but the correlation was inverse. In the Pisca catchment, conductivity, major cations (with the exception of potassium), major anions, and DIC, DO, and DOC had a strong and statistically significant correlation with LUI. Correlation coefficients were also high for respiration rate, although the correlation was not statistically significant.},

abstract = {1 An investigation was conducted to determine the effects of elevated pCO(2) on the net production and calcification of an assemblage of corals maintained under near-natural conditions of temperature, light, nutrient, and flow. Experiments were performed in summer and winter to explore possible interactions between seasonal change in temperature and irradiance and the effect of elevated pCO(2). Particular attention was paid to interactions between net production and calcification because these two processes are thought to compete for the same internal supply of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). A nutrient enrichment experiment was performed because it has been shown to induce a competitive interaction between photosynthesis and calcification that may serve as an analog to the effect of elevated pCO(2). Net carbon production, NPC, increased with increased pCO(2) at the rate of 3 2{\%} (mu mol CO(2)aq kg(-1))(-1). Seasonal change of the slope NPC-CO(2)aq relationship was not significant. Calcification (G) was strongly related to the aragonite saturation state Omega(a). Seasonal change of the G-Omega(a) relationship was not significant. The first-order saturation state model gave a good fit to the pooled summer and winter data: G = (8 1 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) h(-1))(Omega(a) - 1), r(2) = 0.87, P = 0.0001. Both nutrient and CO2 enrichment resulted in an increase in NPC and a decrease in G, giving support to the hypothesis that the cellular mechanism underlying the decrease in calcification in response to increased pCO(2) could be competition between photosynthesis and calcification for a limited supply of DIC.},

abstract = {This project was designed to establish baseline aquatic biological community structure and physical habitat conditions in select wadeable streams within the California Central Valley. A secondary objective was to evaluate possible water quality differences between site types and seasons. Two agricultural and two urban streams were monitored in spring and fall for two consecutive years beginning in the fall of 2002. Bioassessment sampling was conducted according to modified US EPA methods. The study included physical habitat assessment, water and sediment chemical analysis and characterization of the benthic macroinvertebrate community at each site. Water samples were analyzed for selected organophosphate insecticides, pyrethroid insecticides and herbicides, while sediment samples were analyzed for pyrethroids only. All sites had substantial physical habitat and water quality impairments, and the absence of pollution intolerant macroinvertebrates and dominance of pollution tolerant macroinvertebrates were indications of biological impairment. Due to the limited amount of water quality and pesticide data collected, it was not possible to definitively demonstrate any cause and effect relationships between BMI community structure and water quality or pesticide concentrations. Though most physical habitat parameters were similar and EPA physical habitat scores revealed on no significant differences between urban and agricultural sites (P=0.290), a significant difference was seen in substrate embeddedness (P=0.020). Dominant taxon found at all sites were chironomids, amphipods, and oligochaetes. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significantly different between both types of sites (P=0.001) and seasons (P=0.014). Chironomidae taxon and those of the functional feeding group scrapers were greater at urban sites, while those of the functional feeding group filterers were greater at agricultural sites. In addition, the metric groups Chironomidae, filterers, and predators were found in greater numbers in the spring than the fall.},

@article{Doledec2011,
abstract = {. Large-scale comparative studies of ecological responses to anthropological stressors in rivers require measures that are consistent across a range of spatial scales. The biological trait profile of communities offers an alternative approach to traditional measures of macroinvertebrate taxonomic identity and is less constrained by biogeo- graphic influences. 2. We compared the capacities of taxonomic composition and biological trait composition to discriminate the effects of land use (measured as percentage of the catchment in pasture) across a large geographic zone (the whole of New Zealand) in 30 sub-catchments grouped into five ecoregions throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand. In addition, we investigated trait consistency (i.e. whether similar traits had similar trait responses to land use at local (catchment) and broad scales). 3. The analysis of taxonomic composition showed that community structure was indeed influenced by land-use intensity, but that relationships differed among ecoregions. In contrast, traditional assessment metrics (Macroinvertebrate Community Index, richness in Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa) and trait composition were uninfluenced by region. Trait responses were consistent at the broad and catchment scales, with similar traits responding to pastoral land use at both scales. 4.We used general linear modelling to investigate individual trait responses to land-use intensity, catchment area and region, focussing on 15 trait categories known to be influenced by land-use intensity at the catchment scale. Several trait categories varied with land-use intensity and demonstrated consistency at both catchment and broad scales. Of these, the representation of shorter generation time, asexual reproduction and hermaphroditism, ability to lay eggs beneath the water surface, egg protection and respiration types tolerant of oxygen depletion generally increased in assemblages exposed to more intense pastoral land use. At the same time, the representation of short life duration of adults, prevalence of laying eggs at the water surface, sexual reproduction and low body flexibility decreased in assemblages exposed to land-use intensification},

abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Female breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world. Several efforts in artificial intelligence have been made to help improving the diagnostic accuracy at earlier stages. However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts.  In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.},

I compared fish communities across 26 streams with and without culverts. Densities of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) increased whereas coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (C. asper) densities decreased, on both sides, relative to unculverted reference streams. I also found that simple retrofits for improving culvert passage may increase fish diversity over decadal timescales. I then examined the effects of four culverts within one urban watershed and show that successive culverts had a cumulative effect on fish distributions, particularly for prickly sculpin and cutthroat trout (negative and positive, respectively). Overall, this thesis demonstrates that culverts may drive changes in fish communities through species- specific impacts that are consistent both within and across watersheds. Understanding biotic responses to stream fragmentation can inform urban watershed restoration and conservation efforts.},

abstract = {We use focal-species analysis to apply a graph-theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape-level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities, and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least-cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph-theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context, and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity.},

abstract = {Connected ecosystems can be detrimentally affected by the same stressor, such as occurs when excess fine sediment moves from streams into estuaries. However, no previous study has directly compared sedimentation effects across these ecosystems. Responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to sedimentation were predicted to vary between streams and estuaries, because of intersystem differences in the physical environment and representation of species traits. To compare these responses, fine terrigenous sediment was added simultaneously to replicated plots in stream-run habitats and the adjacent estuary. Although sediment addition to streams caused reduced invertebrate densities after 1 week, no changes in taxon richness or consistent changes in community structure were detected, and densities had recovered another week later. In contrast, sediment addition to estuarine sites caused large declines in invertebrate densities and changes in community structure, which remained evident at the innermost sites 16 days after addition. Across both systems, sedimentation effects were detectable only for some of the common taxa, and biological traits were not predictive of effects. The potential for more severe effects in estuaries should be considered when predicting the implications of land-use changes that may increase sedimentation, and when setting guidelines for maintaining stream and estuarine condition.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the distribution of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) in relation to physical variables and to land-cover in the Adour-Garonne stream system (SW France; 116,000 km(2)). The relative abundances of 5 FFGs were calculated from macroinvertebrate data recorded at 165 sampling sites. Each site was characterized using 5 physical variables (elevation, stream order, stream width, distance from the source, slope) and 3 land-cover variables ({\%} forested, {\%} urban areas, {\%} agricultural areas). The sites were first classified using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), according to the physical and land-cover variables. Two major clusters of sites corresponded to anthropogenically modified and natural areas, respectively. Anthropogenically modified areas were clearly divided into agricultural and urban landscapes. Each major cluster was divided into 3-4 subsets of sites according to a topographic gradient of physical variables. To examine the variability of the communities, FFG proportions at the 165 sites were examined on the SOM trained with physical and land-cover variables. When the riverine landscape was natural, FFG patterns responded to the upstream-downstream gradient in physical variables. When the landscape was altered by agriculture or urbanization, the effects of land-cover on FFGs overcame the influence of the physical variables. The categorization of the landscape into forested, agricultural, and urban areas was relevant to detect changes in FFG patterns. In light of increasing development along riparian zones, the use of SOMs to detect responses of FFGs to landscape alterations at regional scales exemplifies an effective technique for assessing river health based on ecological indicator groups.},

abstract = {Statistical energy modelling {\&} analysis of building stock is becoming mainstream in the context of city or district scale analysis of energy saving measures. A common aspect in such analyses is that there is generally a set of key explanatory variables - or the main inputs - that are statistically related to a quantity of interest (end-use energy or CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). In the context of energy use in buildings, it is not uncommon that the explanatory variables may be correlated. However, there has been little discussion about the correlated variables in building stock research. This paper uses a set of campus buildings as a demonstrative case study to investigate the application of variable importance and meta-model construction in the case of correlated inputs when quantifying energy demand of a building stock. The variable importance analysis can identify key factors that explain energy consumption of a building stock. To this end, it is necessary to apply methods suitable for correlated inputs because the observational data (inputs) of buildings are usually correlated. For constructing statistical energy meta-models, two types of regression models are used: linear and non-parametric models. The results indicate that the linear models perform well compared to the complicated non-parametric models in this case. In addition, a simple transformation of the response, commonly used in linear regression, can improve predictive performance of both the linear and non-parametric models.},

Without informed guidelines, management decisions are unlikely to deliver cost-effective improvements in the quality of rivers as required by current water policy. Here, we review the evidence available for deriving improved guidelines on the loading of fine sediment to rivers based on the impact on macro-invertebrates. The relationship between macro-invertebrates and fine sediments is poorly defined. Studies of the impacts of fine sediment on macro-invertebrates have been undertaken at various scales, which has an influence on the range of responses displayed and the reliability of the results obtained; results obtained from investigations at smaller scales may not manifest at the scale required to manage rivers and vice versa. Many of the identified effects of increased loading of fine sediment on macro-invertebrates occur as a consequence of deposition on the river bed, yet many current management guidelines are based on suspended sediment targets. On this basis, existing water quality guidelines for sediment management are unlikely to be appropriate.},

abstract = {Hydromorphological degradation is a well known stressor for running waters, while the effects of elevated levels of pesticides are widely ignored. Hence, distinguishing between the effects of these two stressors is an urgent task for water managers that aim at appropriate remediation measures. We used a large monitoring data set on benthic invertebrates, habitat descriptors, and physico-chemical variables to develop the SPEAR[{\%}](habitat) metric that indicates the effects of in-stream habitat degradation. SPEAR[{\%}](habitat) correlated significantly with the habitat degradation score (HDS; based on substratum and vegetation coverage), while it did not respond to any physico-chemical variables (r(2)=0.20). This relationship improved for streams with low modeled pesticide inputs (r(2)=0.33), and improved even further for a subset of streams dominated by soft-bottom substrata, i.e. for similar stream-types (r(2)=0.65). These relationships were confirmed for an independent dataset that was not used in the derivation of the HDS (r(2)=0.57 and r(2)=0.65, respectively). These findings show that the SPEAR[{\%}](habitat) had a high degree of specificity for the effects of habitat degradation. Conversely, neither the commonly used EPT and ASPT metrics, nor the German Fauna Index or SPEAR[{\%}](pesticides) showed significant relationships with HDS. These metrics instead correlated significantly with the run-off potential (RP), a proxy of pesticide contamination of streams. Similarly, RP was also the most important explanatory variable for SPEAR[{\%}](pesticides), followed by alkalinity and the number of forested upstream stretches (r(2)=0.61). The latter are expected to alleviate pesticide effects, as indicated by higher SPEAR[{\%}](pesticides) values. These findings show that an integrated analysis of the two stressor-specific SPEAR-metrics in combination with the metrics of general ecological degradation can help water managers to distinguish between the effects of habitat degradation and pesticide stress, two co-occurring stressors in agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {To achieve rapid and precise diagnosis of crop diseases, an active and dynamic method of diagnosis of crop diseases is needed and such a method is proposed in this paper. This method adopts Bayesian networks to represent the relationships among the symptoms and crop diseases. This method has two main differences from the existing diagnosis methods. First, it does not use all the symptoms in the diagnosis, but purposively selects a subset of symptoms which are the most relevant to diagnosis; the active symptom selection is based on the concept of a Markov blanket in a Bayesian network. Second, a specific incremental learning algorithm for Bayesian networks is also proposed to make the diagnosis model update dynamically over time in order to adapt to temporal changes of environment. Furthermore, the diagnosis results can be calculated without inference in Bayesian networks, so the method has low time complexity. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of crop disease diagnosis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Epidemiologists rightly work from a science-based approach to causation in epidemiology, but largely disagree about the matter. Disagreement may be partly due to confusion of the question of useful concepts for causal inference in epidemiological practice with the question of the metaphysical presuppositions of causal concepts used in epidemiology. In other words, epidemiologists seem to confuse the practical results of epidemiological research at the population level with the metaphysical views about the reality of disease causation at the individual level in their writings on causation.},

abstract = {Influencing the management of private landholders is a key element of improving the condition of Australia's natural resources. Despite substantial investment by governments, effecting behavioural change on a scale likely to stem biodiversity losses has proven difficult. Understanding landholder decision-making is now acknowledged as fundamental to achieving better policy outcomes. There is a large body of research examining landholder adoption of conservation practices. Social researchers are able to employ a suite of conventional techniques to analyse their survey data and assist in identifying significant and causal relationships between variables. However, these techniques can be limited by the type of data available, the breadth of issues that can be represented and the extent that causality can be explored. In this paper we discuss the findings of a unique study exploring the benefits of combining Bayesian Networks (BNs) with conventional statistical analysis to examine landholder adoption. Our research examined the landholder fencing of native bushland in the Wimmera region in south east Australia. Findings from this study suggest that BNs provided enhanced understanding of the presence and strength of causal relationships. There was also the additional benefit that a BN could be quickly developed and that this process helped the research team clarify and understand relationships between variables. However, a key finding was that the interpretation of the results of the BNs was complemented by the conventional data analysis and expert review. An additional benefit of the BNs is their capacity to present key findings in a format that is more easily interpreted by researchers and enables researchers to more easily communicate their findings to natural resource practitioners and policy makers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The characterisation of river types is based on the guidelines of the Water Framework Directive (Annex II) and existing national classifications. Classification of river types to identify relatively homogeneous ecological systems and associated biological communities is generally required for two main purposes: â¢ Development of river-type specific reference conditions for the assessment of ecological integrity. â¢ Development and implementation of river monitoring programmes to give suitable coverage to all river- and reach-types. The key aim for the FAME project is to develop a typology which proposes the major river types of 16 ecoregions at the national scale so that river-type specific approaches to reference conditions and ecological analyses can be undertaken in the later workpackages (WP 6 and 7 modelling of reference and degraded conditions).},

abstract = {Intensification of catchment land use often adversely affects ecosystem health in rivers and estuaries via changes to physicochemistry and ecosystem functioning, but whether such land-use effects differ along a freshwater-marine continuum has not been studied. We investigated relationships between intensity of land use and two measures of ecosystem function in freshwater, estuarine and near-marine habitats. Standardized bioassays to determine cellulose breakdown (cotton and canvas strips) and algal accrual rates (ceramic tiles) were deployed in 10 river-to-marine continua whose catchment areas ranged from 2.6 to 99.6{\%} developed. Using general linear models and an information-theoretic approach to select the best predictive models for our response variables, we found that higher dissolved phosphorus concentrations, linked with highly developed catchments, were associated with greater rates of cellulose decomposition (both tensile strength loss and mass loss). Furthermore, after controlling for the contribution of phosphorus or salinity, decomposition rates in freshwater and near-marine habitats generally responded curvilinearly to catchment development, indicating the involvement of additional unmeasured, land-use-related physicochemical or biological variables. The strength and shape of relationships between percentage developed land area and algal biomass accrual rates also contrasted among freshwater (strongest, curvilinear), mid-estuary (intermediate, positive), and near-marine sites (weakest, no obvious shape). Because land-use intensity can influence ecosystem functioning along the entire continuum from streams and rivers to estuaries and coasts, resource managers should adopt an integrated approach to decisions affecting catchment land use.},

Here, we explore if trait-abundance patterns of aquatic plants change along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and eutrophication in lowland stream sites located in Denmark. Specifically, we hypothesised that: i) changes in trait-abundance patterns occur along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and ii) trait-abundance patterns can serve to disentangle effects of eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation in lowland streams reflecting that the mechanisms behind changes differ. We used monitoring data from a total of 147 stream reaches with combined data on aquatic plant species abundance, catchment land use, hydromorphological alterations (i.e. planform, cross section, weed cutting) and water chemistry parameters. Traits related to life form, dispersal, reproduction and survival together with ecological preference values for nutrients and light (Ellenberg N and L) were allocated to 41 species representing 79{\%} of the total species pool. We found clear evidence that habitat degradation (hydromorphological alterations and eutrophication) mediated selective changes in the trait-abundance patterns of the plant community. Specific traits could distinguish hydromorphological degradation (free-floating, surface; anchored floating leaves; anchored heterophylly) from eutrophication (free-floating, submerged; leaf area). We provide a conceptual framework for interpretation of how eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation interact and how this is reflected in trait-abundance patterns in aquatic plant communities in lowland streams. Our findings support the merit of trait-based approaches in biomonitoring as they shed light on mechanisms controlling structural changes under environmental stress. The ability to disentangle several stressors is particularly important in lowland stream environments where several stressors act in concert since the impact of the most important stressor can be targeted first, which is essential to improve the ecological status.},

abstract = {In December 1986, U.S. EPA's Assistant Administrator for Water initiated a major study of the Agency's surface water monitoring activities. The resulting report, entitled "Surface Water Monitoring: A Framework for Change" (U.S. EPA 1987), emphasizes the restructuring of existing monitoring programs to better address the Agency's current priorities, e.g., toxics, nonpoint source impacts, and documentation of "environmental results." The study also provides specific recommendations on effecting the necessary changes. Principal among these are: 1. 2. To issue guidance on cost-effective approaches to problem identification and trend assessment. To accelerate the development and application of promising biological monitoring techniques. In response to these recommendations, the Assessment and Watershed Protection Division developed the rapid bioassessment protocols (RBPs) designed to provide basic aquatic life data for water quality management purposes such as problem screening, site ranking, and trend monitoring, and produced a document in 1989 (Plafkin et al. 1989). Although none of the protocols were meant to provide the rigor of fully comprehensive studies, each was designed to supply pertinent, cost-effective information when applied in the appropriate context. As the technical guidance for biocriteria has been developed by EPA, states have found these protocols useful as a framework for their monitoring programs. This document was meant to have a self- corrective process as the science advances; the implementation by state water resource agencies has contributed to refinement of the original RBPs for regional specificity. This revision reflects the advancement in bioassessment methods since 1989 and provides an updated compilation of the most cost-effective and scientifically valid approaches.},

abstract = {For organisms, temperature is one of the most important environmental factors and gains increasing importance due to global warming, since increasing temperatures may pose organisms close to their environmental tolerance limits and, thus, they may become more vulnerable to environmental stressors. We analyzed the temperature-dependence of the water-soluble antioxidant capacity of the cladoceran Moina macrocopa and evaluated its life trait variables with temperature (15, 20, 25, 30Â°C) and humic substance (HS) concentrations (0, 0.18, 0.36, 0.90, 1.79 mM DOC) as stressors. Temperatures below and above the apparent optimum (20Â°C) reduced the antioxidative capacity. Additions of HSs increased body length, but decreased mean lifespan at 15 and 20Â°C. There was no clear HS-effect on offspring numbers at 15, 20, and 30Â°C. At 25Â°C with increasing HS-concentration, lifespan was extended and offspring numbers increased tremendously, reaching 250{\%} of the control. Although the applied HS preparation possesses estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities, a xenohormone mechanism does not seem plausible for the reproductive increase, because comparable effects did not occur at other temperatures. A more convincing explanation appears to be the mitohormesis hypothesis which states that a certain increase of reactive oxygen production leads to improved health and longevity and, with Moina, also to increased offspring numbers. Our results suggest that at least with the eurythermic M. macrocopa, a temperature above the optimum can be beneficial for several life trait variables, even when combined with a chemical stressor. Temperatures approximately 10Â°C above its optimum appear to adversely affect the lifespan and reproduction of M. macrocopa. This indicates that this cladoceran species seems to be able to utilize temperature as an ecological resource in a range slightly above its thermal optimum.},

The standard for measuring these improvements are both chemical$\backslash$nand biological. Yet, we know that many waterbodies still fail to$\backslash$nmeet the goal of the Clean Water Act - to maintain the chemical,$\backslash$nphysical and biological integrity of the nation's waters. Biological$\backslash$nassessments have become increasingly important tools for managing$\backslash$nwater quality to meet the goals of the CWA. These methods, which$\backslash$nuse measurements of aquatic biological communities, are particularly$\backslash$nimportant for evaluating the impacts of chemicals for which there$\backslash$nare no water quality standards, and for non-chemical stressors such$\backslash$nas flow alteration, siltation, and invasive species. However, although$\backslash$nbiological assessments are critical tools for detecting impairment,$\backslash$nthey do not identify the cause or causes of the impairment. The Office$\backslash$nof Water and Office of Research and Development of the US EPA have$\backslash$ndeveloped a process for identifying any type of stressor or combination$\backslash$nof stressors that cause biological impairment. The Stressor Identification$\backslash$n(SI) Guidance is intended to lead water resource managers through$\backslash$na formal and rigorous process that identifies stressors causing biological$\backslash$nimpairment in aquatic ecosystems, and provides a structure for organizing$\backslash$nthe scientific evidence supporting the conclusions.

The SI process is iterative, usually$\backslash$nbeginning with a retrospective analysis of available data. The accuracy$\backslash$nof the identification depends on the quality of data and other information$\backslash$nused in the SI process. In some cases, additional data collection$\backslash$nmay be necessary to accurately identify the stressor(s).

abstract = {Dendritic stream networks are inherently spatially and hierarchically structured, but the effects of this structure on stream communities are largely unknown. My aim was to investigate spatial patterns in stream networks using extensive spatial sampling of both adult and benthic macroinvertebrates in four stream networks on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Using spatial modelling and analyses, I answered questions about appropriate spatial measurements to capture ecological processes in stream networks, metacommunity processes at different scales in space and time, and how local and regional processes interact to structure metacommunities in stream networks. Spatial eigenfunction analyses showed that distance measures that explained most variance in stream macroinvertebrate communities were stream distance and weighted stream distance measures. They performed better than Euclidean distance to measure spatial structure that is ecologi- cally relevant to stream network communities. The spatial pattern of ben- thic stream composition changed significantly, as shown by space-time interactions modelled by MANOVA-like redundancy analysis. Thus, spatial processes structuring stream metacommunities remained constant, in agreement with neutral model predictions. Network-scale properties, particularly flood disturbances, influenced the relative importance of spatial and en- vironmental variation in stream network metacommunities. Additionally, quantile regression indicated that three key variables, habitat size, isolation and local habitat conditions, jointly limited community structure in stream networks, providing empirical support for both island biogeography and metacommunity theories. macroinvertebrates was stable over time, whereas community},

abstract = {In order to increase the diagnostic accuracy of ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system, especially for multiple-simultaneous faults, the paper proposes a multi-source information fusion based fault diagnosis methodology by using Bayesian network, due to the fact that it is considered to be one of the most useful models in the filed of probabilistic knowledge representation and reasoning, and can deal with the uncertainty problem of fault diagnosis well. The Bayesian networks based on sensor data and observed information of human being are established, respectively. Each Bayesian network consists of two layers: fault layer and fault symptom layer. The Bayesian network structure is established according to the cause and effect sequence of faults and symptoms, and the parameters are studied by using Noisy-OR and Noisy-MAX model. The entire fault diagnosis model is established by combining the two proposed Bayesian networks. Six fault diagnosis cases of GSHP system are studied, and the results show that the fault diagnosis model using evidences from only sensor data is accurate for single fault, while it is not accurate enough for multiple-simultaneous faults. By adding the observed information as evidences, the probability of fault present for single fault of "Refrigerant overcharge" increases to 100{\%} from 99.69{\%}, and the probabilities of fault present for multiple-simultaneous faults of "Non-condensable gas" and "Expansion valve port largen" increases to almost 100{\%} from 61.1{\%} and 52.3{\%}, respectively. In addition, the observed information can correct the wrong fault diagnostic results, such as "Evaporator fouling". Therefore, the multi-source information fusion based fault diagnosis model using Bayesian network can increase the fault diagnostic accuracy greatly. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Automated medical diagnosis models are now ubiquitous, and research for developing new ones is constantly growing. They play an important role in medical decision-making, helping physicians to provide a fast and accurate diagnosis. Due to their adaptive learning and nonlinear mapping properties, the artificial neural networks are widely used to support the human decision capabilities, avoiding variability in practice and errors based on lack of experience. Among the most common learning approaches, one can mention either the classical back-propagation algorithm based on the partial derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights, or the Bayesian learning method based on posterior probability distribution of weights, given training data. This paper proposes a novel training technique gathering together the error-correction learning, the posterior probability distribution of weights given the error function, and the Goodman-Kruskal Gamma rank correlation to assembly them in a Bayesian learning strategy. This study had two main purposes; firstly, to develop a. novel learning technique based on both the Bayesian paradigm and the error back-propagation, and secondly,. to assess its effectiveness. The proposed model performance is compared with those obtained by traditional machine learning algorithms using real-life breast and lung cancer, diabetes, and heart attack medical databases. Overall, the statistical comparison results indicate that the. novel. learning approach outperforms the conventional techniques in almost all respects.},

abstract = {We reviewed the literature on the effects of land use changes on mediterranean river ecosystems (med-rivers) to provide a foundation and directions for future research on catchment management during times of rapid human population growth and climate change. Seasonal human demand for water in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions) is high, leading to intense competition for water with riverine communities often containing many endemic species. The responses of river communities to human alterations of land use, vegetation, hydrological, and hydrochemical conditions are similar in mediterranean and other climatic regions. High variation in hydrological regimes in med-regions, however, tends to exacerbate the magnitude of these responses. For example, land use changes promote longer dry season flows, concentrating contaminants, allowing the accumulation of detritus, algae, and plants, and fostering higher temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen levels, all of which may extirpate sensitive native species. Exotic species often thrive in med-rivers altered by human activity, further homogenizing river communities worldwide. We recommend that future research rigorously evaluate the effects of management and restoration practices on river ecosystems, delineate the cause-effect pathways leading from human perturbations to stream biological communities, and incorporate analyses of the effects of scale, land use heterogeneity, and high temporal hydrological variability on stream communities.},

It reviews the key issues and methodological approaches pertinent to the field for which the reader pursues an expatiated overview. It thus serves both as a first orientation for the interested reader and as a starting point for an in-depth study of a specific area, as well as a quick reference and recapitulatory overview for the expert. The book includes topics that are usually missing in standard textbooks. Written for: Biostatisticians, epidemiologists},

abstract = {Sustainability Appraisal (SA) is a complex task that involves integration of social, environmental and economic considerations and often requires trade-offs between multiple stakeholders that may not easily be brought to consensus. Classical SA, often compartmentalised in the rigid boundary of disciplines, can facilitate discussion, but can only partially inform decision makers as many important aspects of sustainability remain abstract and not interlinked. A fully integrated model can overcome compartmentality in the assessment process and provides opportunity for a better integrative exploratory planning process.The objective of this paper is to explore the benefit of an integrated modelling approach to SA and how a structured integrated model can be used to provide a coherent, consistent and deliberative platform to assess policy or planning proposals. The paper discusses a participative and integrative modelling approach to urban river corridor development, incorporating the principal of sustainability. The paper uses a case study site in Sheffield, UK, with three alternative development scenarios, incorporating a number of possible riverside design features. An integrated SA model is used to develop better design by optimising different design elements and delivering a more sustainable (re)-development plan. We conclude that participatory integrated modelling has strong potential for supporting the SA processes. A high degree of integration provides the opportunity for more inclusive and informed decision-making regarding issues of urban development. It also provides the opportunity to reflect on their long-term dynamics, and to gain insights on the interrelationships underlying persistent sustainability problems. Thus the ability to address economic, social and environmental interdependencies within policies, plans, and legislations is enhanced. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecological resilience is developing into a credible paradigm for policy development and environmental management for preserving natural capital in a rapidly changing world. However, resilience emerges from complex interactions, limiting the translation of theory into practice. Main limitations include the following: (i) difficulty in quantification and detection of changes in ecological resilience, (ii) a lack of empirical evidence to support preventative or proactive management and (iii) difficulties in managing processes operating across socio-ecological systems that vary in space and time. We highlight recent research with the potential to address these limitations including new and/or improved indicators of resilience and tools to assess scale as a driver of resilience. Synthesis and applications. Effective resilience-based management must be adaptive in nature. To support this, we propose an operational model using resilience-based iterative management actions operating across scales.},

@article{Porter1999,
abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P {\textgreater} 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

abstract = {Epidemiology uses strong sampling methods and study designs to test refutable hypotheses regarding the causes of important health, mental health, and social outcomes. Epidemiologic methods are increasingly being used to move developmental psychopathology from studies that catalogue correlates of child and adolescent mental health to designs that can test rival hypotheses regarding causal genetic and environmental influences. A two-part strategy is proposed for the next phase of epidemiologic research. First, to facilitate the most informed tests of causal hypotheses, it is necessary to develop and test models of the structure of hypothesized genetic and environmental influences on mental health phenotypes. This will involve testing the related hypotheses that there are both (a) dimensions of psychopathology that are distinct in the sense of having at least some unique genetic and/or environmental influences, and (b) higher-order domains of correlated dimensions that are all apparently influenced in part by the same genetic and/or environmental factors. The resulting causal taxonomy would organize tests of causal hypotheses regarding both factors that may broadly increase risk for multiple dimensions of psychopathology and factors that may specifically increase risk for each individual dimension. Second, it is necessary to make greater use of a number of powerful epidemiologic designs that allow rigorous tests of rival hypotheses regarding genetic and environmental causes.},

Second, the fault layer is determined based on the state decision nodes in the operation procedure layer. Then fault symptom layer including symptoms sensitive to the concerned faults is developed. Finally, the entire Bayesian network is established by integrating the three layers. The presented approach is applied to hydraulic control system of subsea blowout preventer (BOP). Taking an example of closing the BOP, the operation procedures are illustrated. The entire Bayesian network for fault diagnosis of closing the BOP is established.

abstract = {Mitigation activities to improve water quality and quantity in streams as well as stream management and restoration efforts are conducted in the European Union aiming to improve the chemical, physical and ecological status of streams. Headwater streams are often characterised by impairment of hydromorphological, chemical, and ecological conditions due to multiple anthropogenic impacts. However, they are generally disregarded as water bodies for mitigation activities in the European Water Framework Directive despite their importance for supporting a higher ecological quality in higher order streams. We studied 11 headwater streams in the Hove catchment in the Copenhagen region. All sites had substantial physical habitat and water quality impairments due to anthropogenic influence (intensive agriculture, urban settlements, contaminated sites and low base-flow due to water abstraction activities in the catchment). We aimed to identify the dominating anthropogenic stressors at the catchment scale causing ecological impairment of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and provide a rank-order of importance that could help in prioritising mitigation activities. We identified numerous chemical and hydromorphological impacts of which several were probably causing major ecological impairments, but we were unable to provide a robust rank-ordering of importance suggesting that targeted mitigation efforts on single anthropogenic stressors in the catchment are unlikely to have substantial effects on the ecological quality in these streams. The SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) index explained most of the variability in the macroinvertebrate community structure, and notably, SPEAR index scores were often very low ({\textless}10{\%} SPEAR abundance). An extensive re-sampling of a subset of the streams provided evidence that especially insecticides were probably essential contributors to the overall ecological impairment of these streams. Our results suggest that headwater streams should be considered in future management and mitigation plans. Catchment-based management is necessary because several anthropogenic stressors exceeded problematic thresholds, suggesting that more holistic approaches should be preferred.},

abstract = {Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled (seven Surber samples per site) in 88 rivers throughout New Zealand in "runs" (velocity 0.4-0.8 m s"1, depth = 0.3-0.6 m), under autumn baseflow conditions (Q {\textless} median). Medians and 10-90 percentiles for the following community level characteristics were: taxa richness, 14 and 7-20(0.7 nr2); Shannon Diversity (//'), 1.33and 0.80-1.90; total density, 1900 and 230-6700 nr2; and total biomass, 0.608 and 0.112-2.932 g AFDW nr2. Invertebrate abundance and taxonomic richness were lowest in rivers with beds of silt or sand, or cobbles overlain with sand deposits. Comparisons of environmental factors between sites grouped by TWINSPAN indicated that the degree of catchment development to improved pasture, water temperature, and level of enrichment (indicated by increased nutrients and periphyton biomass) are important factors affecting invertebrate community structure in New Zealand rivers. Mayflies, stoneflies, and predatory caddisflies were associated with cooler, less enriched, steeper, and more elevated sites than snails, crustaceans, chironomids, and worms. Stonefly biomass was minimal at sites having mean annual temperatures {\textgreater}13Â°C. The following community characteristics emerged as useful indicators of the level of water enrichment: the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI) and its quantitative analog (QMCI); the presence of some species (e.g., Zelandoperla decorata snABereoptera roria), and the densities of some widely distributed taxa (e.g., Deleatidium spp. mdPsilochorema spp.); percentage predator biomass; and the number of ephemeropteran, plecopteran, and trichopteran taxa (EPT). Sites did not separate out clearly into ecoregions, although rivers with "clean-water" faunas were more predominant in the South Island than in the North Island. This is thought to reflect the greater degree of development of the North Island catchments.},

abstract = {In the marine environment, humans exploit natural ecosystems for food and economic benefit. Challenging policy goals have been set to protect resources, species, communities and habitats, yet ecologists often have sparse data on interactions occurring in the system to assess policy outcomes. This paper presents a technique, loosely based on Bayesian Belief Networks, to create simple models which 1) predict whether individual species within a community will decline or increase in population size, 2) encapsulate uncertainty in the predictions in an intuitive manner and 3) require limited knowledge of the ecosystem and functional parameters required to model it. We develop our model for a UK rocky shore community, to utilise existing knowledge of species interactions for model validation purposes. However, we also test the role of expert opinion, without full scientific knowledge of species interactions, by asking non-UK based marine scientists to derive parameters for the model (non-UK scientists are not familiar with the exact communities being described and will need to extrapolate from existing knowledge in a similar manner to model a poorly studied system). We find these differ little from the parameters derived by ourselves and make little difference to the final model predictions. We also test our model against simple experimental manipulations, and find that the most important changes in community structure as a result of manipulations correspond well to the model predictions with both our, and non-UK expert parameterisation. The simplicity of the model, nature of the outputs, and the user-friendly interface makes it potentially suitable for policy, conservation and management work on multispecies interactions in a wide range of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Recent research has revealed that one of the most important characteristics of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances is their temporal heterogeneity. However, little is known about the relative importance of interactions among temporal patterns of multiple stressors. We established a fully factorial field experiment to test whether interactions among temporal patterns of two globally important anthropogenic disturbances of aquatic ecosystems (increased sediment loading and nutrient enrichment) determined the responses of stream benthic assemblages. Each disturbance treatment comprised three distinct regimes: regular and temporally variable pulses and an undisturbed control. The overall frequency, intensity and extent of disturbance was, however, equal across all disturbed treatments. We found that interactions among temporal disturbance regimes determined the effects of the compounded sediment and nutrient perturbations on algal biomass and the diversity, taxonomic and trophic composition of benthic...},

abstract = {In a text-to-speech system, the duration of each phone may be predicted by a duration model. This model is usually trained using a database of phones with known durations; each phone (and the context it appears in) is characterised by a feature vector that is composed of a set of linguistic factor values. We describe the use of a graphical model - a Bayesian network - for predicting the duration of a phone, given the values for these factors. The network has one discrete variable for each of the linguistic factors and a single continuous variable for the phone's duration. Dependencies between variables (or the lack of them) are represented in the BN structure by arcs (or missing arcs) between pairs of nodes. During training, both the topology of the network and its parameters are learned from labelled data. We compare the results of the BN model with results for sums of products and CART models on the same data. In terms of the root mean square error, the BN model performs much better than both CART and SoP models. In terms of correlation coefficient, the BN model performs better than the SoP model, and as well as the CART model. A BN model has certain advantages over CART and SoP models. Training SoP models requires a high degree of expertise. CART models do not deal with interactions between factors in any explicit way. As we demonstrate, a BN model can also make accurate predictions of a phone's duration, even when the values for some of the linguistic factors are unknown. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Boreal lakes undergo broad-scale environmental change over time, but biodiversity responses to these changes, particularly at macroecological scales, are not well known. We studied long-term trends (1992-2009) of environmental variables and assessed $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ diversity responses of phytoplankton and littoral invertebrates to these changes. Diversity was assessed based on taxon richness ("richness") and the exponentiated Shannon entropy ("diversity"). Almost all environmental variables underwent significant monotonic change over time, indicating mainly decreasing acidification, water clarity and nutrient concentrations in the lakes. These variables explained about 54 and 38{\%} of variance in regression models of invertebrates and phytoplankton, respectively. Despite this, most diversity-related variables fluctuated around a long-term mean. Only $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ richness and diversity of invertebrates increased monotonically through time, and these patterns correlated significantly with local and regional abundances. Results suggest that biodiversity in boreal lakes is currently stable, with no evidence of regional biotic homogenization or local diversity loss. Results also show that richness trends between phytoplankton and invertebrates were widely uncorrelated, and the same was found for diversity trends. Also, within each taxonomic group, temporal patterns of richness and diversity were largely uncorrelated with each other. From an applied perspective, this suggest that long-term trends of biodiversity in boreal lakes at a macroecological scale cannot be accurately assessed without multiple lines of evidence, i.e. through the use of multiple taxa and diversity-related variables in the analyses.},

abstract = {Inference in Bayesian networks (BNs) is NP-hard. We proposed the concept of a node set namely Maximum Quadruple-Constrained subset MQC(A, a - e) to improve the efficiency of exact inference in diagnostic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Here, A denotes a node set in a DBN and a - e represent five real numbers. The improvement in efficiency is achieved by computation sharing. That is, we divide inference in a DBN into the computation of eliminating MQC(A, a - e) and the subsequent computation. For certain complex DBNs and (A, a - e), the former computation covers a major part of the whole computation, and the latter one is highly efficient after sharing the former computation. Searching for MQC(A, a - e) is a combinatorial optimization problem. A backtracking-based exact algorithm Backtracking-Search (BS) was proposed, however the time complexity of BS is O(n 32 n) (n = |A|). In this article, we propose the following algorithms for searching for MQC(A, a - e) especially in complex DBNs where |A| is large. (i) A divide-and-conquer algorithm Divide-and-Conquer (DC) for dividing the problem of searching for MQC(A, a - e) into sub-problems of searching for MQC(B 1, a - e), ..., MQC(B m, a - e), where B i A(1 ??? i ??? m, 1 ??? m ??? |A|). (ii) A DC-based heuristic algorithm Heuristic-Search (HS) for searching for MQC(B i, a - e). The time complexity of HS is O(n 6) (n = |B i|). Empirical results show that, HS outperforms BS over a range of networks. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Risk assessment procedures use toxicity tests in which organisms are subjected to chemicals under otherwise constant and favorable experimental conditions. Because variable and suboptimal environmental conditions are common aspects of natural ecosystems, the hazard of underestimation of risk arises. Therefore, an uncertainty factor is used in the extrapolation of results of standard toxicity tests to field situations. The choice for these uncertainty factors is based on little ecological evidence. This review discusses studies on the toxicity of various chemicals to aquatic organisms, modified by temperature, nutritional state and salinity, excluding papers on changes in bioavailability of compounds. Collected data were analyzed quantitatively to evaluate the validity of toxicity data obtained from standard toxicity tests in the laboratory under field conditions. Generally, organisms living under conditions close to their environmental tolerance limits appeared to be more vulnerable to additional chemical stress. Usually, increasing temperature and decreasing food or nutrient level raised toxicity. The influence of salinity was less clear; metal toxicity increased with decreasing salinity, toxicity of organophosphate insecticides increased with higher salinity, while for other chemicals no clear relationship between toxicity and salinity was observed. The interactions can be explained by several physical and physiological processes, acting on factors such as bioavailability, toxicokinetics, and sensitivity of organisms. Quantitative analysis of data indicated that an uncertainty factor for the laboratory to field extrapolation should be smaller than one for an ecosystem in a temperate region, while a factor greater than one would be appropriate for systems nearby discharge points of cooling water. The factor should be greater than one when varying nutritional state is concerned, but smaller than one with respect to salinity. Dependent on the effect parameter used, the differences in toxicity between laboratory and relevant field situations ranged from a factor of 2.6 to 130 and 1.7 to 15 for the two temperature conditions and 1.2 to 10 for nutritional state. A salinity increase from freshwater to marine water decreased toxicity by a factor of 2.1. However, as less extreme salinity changes are more relevant under field conditions, the change in toxicity is probably much smaller. To obtain uncertainty factors that sufficiently protect natural systems without being overprotective, additional research is required.},

abstract = {Agricultural land uses can impact stream ecosystems by reducing suitable habitat, altering flows, and increasing inputs of diffuse pollutants including fine inorganic sediment ({\textless} 2 mm). These changes have been linked to altered community composition and declines in biodiversity. Determining the mechanisms driving stream biotic responses, particularly threshold impacts, has, however, proved elusive. To investigate a sediment threshold response by benthic invertebrates, an intensive survey of 30 agricultural streams was conducted along gradients of deposited sediment and dissolved nutrients. Partial redundancy analysis showed that invertebrate community composition changed significantly along the gradient of deposited fine sediment, whereas the effect of dissolved nitrate was weak. Pollution-sensitive invertebrates ({\%}EPT, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) demonstrated a strong nonlinear response to sediment, and change-point analysis indicated marked declines beyond a threshold of -20{\%} fine sediment covering the streambed. Structural equation modeling indicated that decreased habitat availability (i.e., coarse substrate and associated interstices) was the key driver affecting pollution-sensitive invertebrates, with degraded riparian condition controlling resources through direct (e.g., inputs) and indirect (e.g., flow-mediated) effects on deposited sediment. The identification of specific effects thresholds and the underlying mechanisms (e.g., loss of habitat) driving these changes will assist managers in setting sediment criteria and standards to better guide stream monitoring and rehabilitation.},

abstract = {How to scale up from local-scale interactions to regional-scale dynamics is a critical issue in field ecology. We show how to implement a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up, using scale transition theory. Scale transition theory shows that dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from predictions based on the local dynamics alone because of an interaction between local-scale nonlinear dynamics and spatial variation in density or the environment. Based on this theory, a systematic approach to scaling up has four steps: (1) derive a model to translate the effects of local dynamics to the regional scale, and to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation, (2) measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales, (3) measure spatial variation, and (4) combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. We illustrate the approach, with an example from benthic stream ecology of caddisflies living in riffles. By sampling from a simulated system, we show how collecting the appropriate data at local (riffle) scales to measure nonlinearities, combined with measures of spatial variation, leads to the correct inference for dynamics at the larger scale of the stream. The approach provides a way to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of changes in population dynamics with spatial scale using a relatively small amount of field data.},

abstract = {Formal safety assessment (FSA), as a structured and systematic risk evaluation methodology, has been increasingly and broadly used in the shipping industry around the world. Concerns have been raised as to navigational safety of the Yangtze River, China's largest and the world's busiest inland waterway. Over the last few decades, the throughput of ships in the Yangtze River has increased rapidly due to the national development of the Middle and Western parts of China. Accidents such as collisions, groundings, contacts, oil-spills and fires occur repeatedly, often causing serious consequences. In order to improve the navigational safety in the Yangtze River, this paper estimates the navigational risk of the Yangtze River using the FSA concept and a Bayesian network (BN) technique. The navigational risk model is established by considering both probability and consequences of accidents with respect to a risk matrix method, followed by a scenario analysis to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Agricultural pesticides are known to significantly impact the composition of communities in stream ecosystems. Moreover, agricultural streams are often characterised by loss of physical habitat diversity which may impose additional stress resulting from suboptimal environmental conditions. We surveyed pesticide contamination and rates of leaf litter decomposition in 14 1st and 2nd order Danish streams using litter bags with coarse and fine mesh sizes. Two sites differing in physical habitat complexity were sampled in each stream, and we used this approach to differentiate the effects of pesticides between sites with uniform (silt and sand) and more heterogeneous physical properties. Microbial litter decomposition was reduced by a factor two to four in agricultural streams compared to forested streams, and we found that the rate of microbial litter decomposition responded most strongly to pesticide toxicity for microorganisms and not to eutrophication. Moreover, the rate of microbial litter decomposition was generally 50{\%} lower at sites with uniform physical habitats dominated by soft substrate compared to the sites with more heterogeneous physical habitats. The rate of macroinvertebrate shredding activity was governed by the density of shredders, and the density of shredders was not correlated to pesticide contamination mainly due to high abundances of the amphipod Gammarus pulex at all sites. Our study provides the first field based results on the importance of multiple stressors and their potential to increase the effect of agricultural pesticides on important ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {One objective of the European Union (EU)'s Water Framework Directive (WFD: Directive 2000/60/EC) is for all European surface waters to achieve 'good status' by 2015. In support of this objective, the EU has facilitated an intercalibration exercise to ensure harmonized definitions of the status of water bodies, reflecting the deviation of their properties (mainly biotic assemblages) from a minimally disturbed state, termed the "reference condition". One of the major challenges of the WFD has been to find common approaches for defining reference conditions and to define the level of anthropogenic intervention allowed in reference sites. In this paper we describe how river reference sites were selected in the Central-Baltic region of Europe. A list of pressure criteria was provided and 14 Member States (MSs) categorized each criterion according to the method (i.e. measured, field inspection, etc.) used for reference site screening. Additionally, reference land-use and water-chemistry thresholds were agreed among countries in order to base reference site selection on objective criteria. For land-use criteria, a reference threshold and a rejection threshold were established. Sites with all criteria below the reference threshold were considered to be reference sites; sites having most criteria below the reference threshold and only some parameters between the reference and rejection threshold were "possible reference sites". These sites were retained only after carefully checking the cumulative effects of the pressures using local expertise, and a posteriori water-chemistry evaluation was necessary. In general, the most widespread method for defining a reference site was the measurement of pressures, followed by field inspections and expert judgment. However, some major pressures (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) were evaluated in a number of different ways (e.g. measured, field inspection, expert judgment). Our meta-analyses reveal a need to reinforce standardization in the application of pressure criteria by Member States. The pressure criteria identified in this exercise should be refined and tested with biological data to help in the further validation of minimally disturbed sites (i.e. the WFD "reference condition") and to provide a firm foundation for ecological status assessment. This in turn would ensure that there is pan-European comparability when evaluating the achievement of environmental objectives.},

abstract = {1. Predicting population dynamics at large spatial scales requires integrating information about spatial distribution patterns, inter-patch movement rates and within-patch processes. Advective dispersal of aquatic species by water movement is considered paramount to understanding their population dynamics. Rivers are model advective systems, and the larvae of baetid mayflies are considered quintessential dispersers. Egg laying of baetids along channels is patchy and reflects the distribution of oviposition sites, but larvae are assumed to drift frequently and far, thereby erasing patterns created during oviposition. Dispersal kernels are often overestimated, however, and empirical tests of such assumptions are warranted because of the pivotal role distribution patterns can have on populations. 2. We tested empirically whether the egg distribution patterns arising from oviposition behaviours persisted and were reflected in the distribution patterns of larval Baetis rhodani. In field surveys, we tested for associations between egg mass and larval densities over 1 km lengths of four streams. A control species, the mayfly Ephemerella ignita, was employed to test for covarying environmental factors. We estimated drift rates directly to test whether larvae dispersed between riffles (patches of high egg mass density) and whether drift rates were density-dependent or density-related - expected outcomes if drift erases patterns established by maternal behaviours. 3. Positive associations between egg masses and larval benthic densities were found for neonate and mid-stage larvae of Baetis, but not the control species, suggesting persistence of the patchy distribution patterns established at oviposition. Drift rates were high, and riffles were net exporters of neonate and mid-stage larvae, but drift rates were unrelated to benthic densities and few drifters reached the next riffle. Riffles were sinks for large larvae, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in habitat use, but little long-distance dispersal. 4. Overall, the results suggest that most neonate and mid-stage larvae of B. rhodani remain close to the natal riffle, and late-stage larvae disperse shorter distances than routinely assumed. The persistence of maternal effects on distribution patterns well into juvenile life of an allegedly iconic disperser suggests that traditional models of how dispersal influences the population dynamics of many lotic invertebrates may be incorrect.},

abstract = {1. Stream reaches found to be impaired by physical, chemical or biological assessment generally are associated with greater extent of urban and agricultural land uses, and lesser amount of undeveloped lands. However, because stream condition commonly is influenced by multiple stressors as well as underlying natural gradients, it can be difficult to establish mechanistic relationships between altered land use and impaired stream condition. 2. This study explores the use of Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model presumed causal relationships between stressors and response variables. A BBN depicts the chain of causal relationships resulting in some outcome such as environmental impairment and can make use of evidence from expert judgment as well as observational and experimental data. 3. Three case studies illustrate the flexibility of BBN models. Expert elicitation in a workshop setting was employed to model the effects of sedimentation on benthic invertebrates. A second example used empirical data to explore the influence of natural and anthropogenic gradients on stream habitat in a highly agricultural watershed. The third application drew on several forms of evidence to develop a decision support tool linking grazing and forestry practices to stream reach condition. 4. Although data limitations challenge model development and our ability to narrow the range of possible outcomes, model formulation forces participants to conceptualise causal mechanisms and consider how to resolve data shortfalls. With sufficient effort and resources, models with greater evidentiary strength from observational and experimental data may become practical tools to guide management decisions. 5. Such models may be used to explore possible outcomes associated with a range of scenarios, thus benefiting management decision-making, and to improve insight into likely causal relationships.},

The response of interest was surface water depletion expressed as the source of water-to-wells. The results have application for managing allocation of groundwater. Each technique was tuned using cross validation and further evaluated using a held-out dataset. A numerical MODFLOW-USG model of the Lake Michigan Basin, USA, was used for the evaluation. The performance and interpretability of each technique was compared pointing to advantages of each technique. The metamodel can extend to unmodeled areas.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Considerable evidence from around the world shows that achieving good ecological outcomes in rivers from programmes of measures in catchments is difficult. There are a number of reasons for this, which we discuss, but here we focus primarily on the question, âIs the knowledge base adequate?' 2. We develop further the thesis that catchments and receiving waters are truly complex systems in which there are fundamental limits to knowledge. Our sampling and data analysis practices come with strong biases and inbuilt âframing' assumptions about the nature and values of ecosystem processes that underestimate complexity and uncertainty. 3. If we reframe our assumptions to think of the problem in terms of the properties of complex systems, then we can rethink our attitudes to uncertainty, causal thickets (multiple stressors) and cross-scale effects, and we can begin to develop new definitions of what constitutes a âgood' ecological outcome. Dealing with inherent variability in data then becomes less of a problem with controlling ânoise' and more of a problem of understanding system dynamics. The presence of adaptive dynamics and self-organisation in complex systems means that uncertainties will always be large and knowledge will be partial and that such systems are fundamentally not computable. 4. We show that small-scale ânoise' in ecosystems is an inherent property of non-equilibrium systems with predominant advection, reactionâdiffusion dynamics. Flow paths in catchments and the dynamics of receiving waters have fractal properties. Fractal dynamics indicate that multiple, cross-scale interactions are a characteristic of these systems. Small-scale connectivity is an important (and, from a management point of view, underused) aspect of pattern and process in such systems. 5. In an environment of such complexity, models will be flawed and predictions uncertain. It is therefore necessary to develop new indicators of connectivity and ecological complexity so that indicators of system-level progress may be found to assist with an improved process of adaptive management that is trend-orientated as well as outcome-orientated.},

abstract = {Sediments have a major role in ecosystem functioning but can also act as physical or chemical stressors. Anthropogenic activities may change the chemical constituency of sediments and the rate, frequency, and extent of sediment transport, deposition, and resuspension. The importance of sediments as stressors will depend on site ecosystem attributes and the magnitude and preponderance of co-occurring stressors. Contaminants are usually of greater ecological consequence in human-modified, depositional environments, where other anthropogenic stressors often co-occur. Risk assessments and restoration strategies should better consider the role of chemical contamination in the context of multiple stressors. There have been numerous advances in the temporal and spatial characterization of stressor exposures and quantification of biological responses. Contaminated sediments causing biological impairment tend to be patchy, whereas more pervasive anthropogenic stressors, such as alterations to habitat and flow, physical disturbance, and nutrient addition, may drive large-scale ecosystem responses. A systematic assessment of relevant ecosystem attributes and reference conditions can assist in understanding the importance of sediments in the context of other stressors. Experimental manipulations then allow for the controlled study of dominant stressors and the establishment of causal links. This approach will result in more effective management of watersheds and waterways.},

abstract = {California faces a wave of licensing of dams for power production, with approximately half of the dams scheduled to be licensed over the next 15 years. The number of projects, the cost of the licensing process, and the increased appreciation of the complexity of stream ecosystems, highlight the need for better methods for determining how much water should to be left in the streams, using Environmental Flow Methodologies. The authors examined the range of methods available assessing environmental flows in relation to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing processes in California. We specifically sought to integrate insights from allied fields not usually applied to environmental flow methodologies. A particular goal was to see if environmental flow methodologies in use in California are consistent with generally accepted practice in the scientific community, especially in their statistical approaches to problems. The researcher's basic findings include: (1) environmental flow methodologies used most frequently in California are seriously flawed, including their underlying statistical foundations; (2) alternatives are available (e.g., using Bayesian Networks) that are both more effective and likely less costly; (3) The fish assemblages of California streams have a complex relationship to flows but it is possible to manage regulated streams to favor desired fish assemblages (e.g., endemic fishes); (4) Required monitoring programs for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission projects are generally inadequate and, as a result, have a high probability of leading to erroneous conclusions about the effects of projects on fish populations. The overall results of this research indicate that the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental flow evaluations can be increased, while reducing their costs and providing benefits to both fish and water users.

abstract = {1. Patterns of connectivity are critical to structuring both spatial and temporal variation in the composition of species populations and assemblages. Water resource development has an important impact on longitudinal connectivity in rivers, and disrupts natural patterns of dispersal of individuals between segments of the river network. Consequently, artificial barriers alter the structure, size and distribution of species populations leading to impacts on aquatic biodiversity. 2. Quantitative assessment of the ecological effects of connectivity alteration is necessary to develop effective conservation plans to manage the impacts of anthropogenic fragmentation. Connectivity alteration is a complex environmental disturbance because the potential scale of impact is dependent on the spatial scale at which biota undergo life-history processes such as spawning and recruitment. Few river networks have single migration barriers, meaning that multiple points of fragmentation are present and have potentially interacting effects. Therefore, conventional control-impact' approaches to impact assessment may be inappropriate or confounded. Furthermore, monitoring patterns of fish population or assemblage structure moving through fish passage facilities alone creates a mismatch between the spatial scale of impact and assessment of water resource development. 3. This paper uses a case study in subtropical Australia to highlight three potential approaches to increasing inference of the impact of fragmentation by barriers on riverine fish. Thorough understanding of life-history and dispersal ecology of fish is necessary to understand and predict the consequences of fragmentation, and comparing patterns of distribution among species with different migration requirements can identify sources of fragmentation. Monitoring patterns in fish assemblages at both the barrier and river network scale increases the strength of inference of the effects of connectivity alteration and management. Experimental removal of artificial barriers would assist in determining the effect of fragmentation by restoring connectivity. Such approaches would improve predictions of connectivity management and underlying drivers of aquatic biodiversity. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change and land-use change are having substantial impacts on biodiversity world-wide, but few studies have considered the impact of these factors together. If the combined effects of climate and land-use change are greater than the effects of each threat individually, current conservation management strategies may be inefficient and/or ineffective. This is particularly important with respect to freshwater ecosystems because freshwater biodiversity has declined faster than either terrestrial or marine biodiversity over the last three decades. This is the first study to model the independent and combined effects of climate change and land-use change on freshwater macroinvertebrates and fish. Using a case study in south-east Queensland, Australia, we built a Bayesian belief network populated with a combination of field data, simulations, existing models and expert judgment. Different land-use and climate scenarios were used to make predictions on how the richness of freshwater macroinvertebrates and fish is likely to respond in future. We discovered little change in richness averaged across the region, but identified important impacts and effects at finer scales. High nutrients and high runoff as a result of urbanization combined with high nutrients and high water temperature as a result of climate change and were the leading drivers of potential declines in macroinvertebrates and fish at fine scales. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to separate out the constituent drivers of impacts on biodiversity that result from climate change and land-use change. Mitigation requires management actions that reduce in-stream nutrients, slows terrestrial runoff and provides shade, to improve the resilience of biodiversity in streams. Encouragingly, the restoration of riparian habitats is identified as an important buffering tool that can mitigate the negative effects of climate change and land-use change.},

A functional HAZOP study is carried out firstly where a functional plant model (i.e., MFM) assists in a goal oriented decomposition of the plant purpose into the means of achieving the purpose. DBN model is then developed based on the functional HAZOP results to provide a probability-based knowledge representation which is appropriate for the modeling of causal processes with uncertainty. An intelligent fault diagnosis system (IFDS) is proposed based on the whole integrated framework, and investigated in a case study of process plants at a petrochemical corporation. The study shows that the IFDS provides a very efficient paradigm for facilitating HAZOP studies and for enabling reasoning to reveal potential causes and/or consequences far away from the site of the deviation online.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

abstract = {Using macroinvertebrates as ecological indicators for different stressors has a long tradition. However, when applied to field data, one often observes correlations between different macroinvertebrate indices that can be attributed to both correlations of stressors and inherent correlations due to the sensitivity of taxa to different stressors. Ignoring the source of any given correlation leads to ambiguous conclusions about the impact of different stressors.Here, we demonstrate how to distinguish the causes of correlation by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We assessed to which degree trait-based indices are stressor-specific and whether this depends on the pool of taxa and its taxonomic resolution. Therefore, we (1) analysed the frequencies of "sensitive" and "insensitive" taxa for pairwise combinations of different indices, (2) analysed the inherent correlation of indices with random samples from different taxon pools derived from field samples and from a complete species list of a whole ecoregion, and (3) compared this inherent correlation with the actual correlation of the field samples. We exemplified this approach by analysing two existing indices (SPEARpesticides, Saprobic Index) and new indices for temperature, flow and pH stress. We used these new indices to illustrate our approach while in-depth testing of their applicability was not the focus of our study.We found strong correlations between several indices in our study area at the Swiss Plateau. The probability that this correlation is only due to inherent correlation in the taxa sensitivities was low (maximum of 0.34). The problem of inherent correlation between indices is more severe for the smaller taxon pool with lower taxonomic resolution.Correlation in the sensitivity of different taxa to different stressors leads to an inherent correlation in trait-based indices, which weakens their explanatory power. Our results highlight the importance of correlation analyses when using trait-based indices to guide ecosystem-management, especially in regions with reduced biodiversity.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the effects of nutrient enrichment in lotic systems has been advanced over the last two decades such that identification of management thresholds for the prevention of eutrophication is now possible. This study describes relationships among primary nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), benthic chlorophyll a concentrations, daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and the condition of macroinvertebrate and fish communities in small rivers and streams in Ohio, USA. Clear associations between nutrients, secondary response indicators (i.e., benthic chlorophyll and DO), and biological condition were found, and change points between the various indicators were identified for use in water quality criteria for nutrients in small rivers and streams ({\textless}1300 km(2)). A change point in benthic chlorophyll a density was detected at an inorganic nitrogen concentration of 0.435 mg/l (+/-0.599 SD), and a total phosphorus (TP) concentration of 0.038 mg/l (+/-0.085 SD). Daily variation in DO concentration was significantly related to benthic chlorophyll concentration and canopy cover, and a change point in 24-h DO concentration range was detected at a benthic chlorophyll level of 182 mg/m(2). The condition of macroinvertebrate communities was related to benthic chlorophyll concentration and both minimum and 24-h range of DO concentration. The condition of fish communities was best explained by habitat quality. The thresholds found in relationships between the stressor and the response variables, when interpreted in light of the uncertainty surrounding individual change points, may now serve as a framework for nutrient criteria in water quality standards.},

abstract = {Eutrophication and acidification are among the major stressors on freshwater ecosystems in northern Europe and North America, but possible consequences of interactions between pH and nutrients on ecological status assessment and species richness patterns have not previously been assessed. Using data from 52 river sites throughout Norway, we investigated the combined effects of pH and nutrients on benthic algae assemblages, specifically 1) taxa-specific couplings between nutrient and acidity traits, 2) the degree of consistency between different biotic indices, separately for nutrients and acid conditions, 3) the impact of pH on nutrient indices and phosphorus on indices of acid conditions, and 4) the impact of pH and phosphorus supply on diatom and non-diatom taxon richness. We found that 1) acid-tolerant taxa are generally associated with nutrient-poor conditions, with only a few exceptions; this is probably more a consequence of habitat availability than reflecting true ecological niches; 2) correlation coefficients between nutrient indices and TP, as well as acid conditions indices and pH were barely affected when the confounding factor was removed; 3) the association of acid-tolerant taxa with nutrient-poor conditions means that the lowest possible nutrient index at a site, as indicated by benthic algae, is lower at acid than at circumneutral sites. Although this may be an artifact of the datasets from which taxa-specific indicator values were derived, it could lead to a drift in nutrient indices with recovery from acidification; 4) the response of non-diatom taxon richness follows a complex pattern with a synergistic interaction between nutrient supply and pH. In contrast, diatom richness follows a simple additive pattern; this suggests structural differences between diatoms and non-diatom benthic algae in their response to nutrient supply and pH; diatom taxon richness tended to increase with nutrient supply, while non-diatom richness decreased.},

abstract = {Channel reconfiguration is a popular but controversial approach to river restoration, and ecological responses to channel reconfiguration have not been rigorously assessed. We compared physical-habitat variables, taxonomic and functional-trait diversities, taxonomic composition, and functional-trait abundances between 24 pairs of upstream (control) and downstream reconfigured (restored) reaches in 3 catchment land uses (urban, agricultural, rural) across the North Carolina Piedmont. We asked how environmental filters and functional species traits might provide insight to biological responses to restoration. Taxonomic and functional-trait differences between control and restored reaches suggest that restoration affected aquatic assemblages only in agricultural and rural catchments. Our results highlight 2 important aspects of channel reconfiguration as a restoration practice. First, responses to restoration differ between agricultural/rural and urban catchments, possibly because of modified hydrological regimes caused by urbanization. Second, we find evidence that channel reconfiguration disturbs food and habitat resources in stream ecosystems. Taxa sensitive to disturbance were characteristic of control reaches, whereas insensitive taxa were characteristic of restored reaches. Abundances of traits related to reproduction (voltinism, development, synchronization of emergence, adult life span), mobility (occurrence in drift, maximum crawling rate, swimming ability), and use of resources (trophic and habitat preferences) differed significantly between control and recently restored reaches. Our results suggest that taxa in restored habitats are environmentally selected for traits favored in disturbed environments. Our work suggests how functional-trait approaches could benefit the practice of river restoration when used to target restoration activities and to develop informed expectations regarding recovery following restoration activities.},

abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

abstract = {Causation is an essential concept in epidemiology, yet there is no single, clearly articulated definition for the discipline. From a systematic review of the literature, five categories can be delineated: production, necessary and sufficient, sufficient-component, counterfactual, and probabilistic. Strengths and weaknesses of these categories are examined in terms of proposed characteristics of a useful scientific definition of causation: it must be specific enough to distinguish causation from mere correlation, but not so narrow as to eliminate apparent causal phenomena from consideration. Two categories-production and counterfactual-are present in any definition of causation but are not themselves sufficient as definitions. The necessary and sufficient cause definition assumes that all causes are deterministic. The sufficient-component cause definition attempts to explain probabilistic phenomena via unknown component causes. Thus, on both of these views, heavy smoking can be cited as a cause of lung cancer only when the existence of unknown deterministic variables is assumed. The probabilistic definition, however, avoids these assumptions and appears to best fit the characteristics of a useful definition of causation. It is also concluded that the probabilistic definition is consistent with scientific and public health goals of epidemiology. In debates in the literature over these goals, proponents of epidemiology as pure science tend to favour a narrower deterministic notion of causation models while proponents of epidemiology as public health tend to favour a probabilistic view. The authors argue that a single definition of causation for the discipline should be and is consistent with both of these aims. It is concluded that a counterfactually-based probabilistic definition is more amenable to the quantitative tools of epidemiology, is consistent with both deterministic and probabilistic phenomena, and serves equally well for the acquisition and the application of scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential use of biological and ecological traits of macroinvertebrates as indicator systems of quality conditions in freshwater ecosystems. To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twentytwo variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the AllierâLoire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities},

abstract = {Global environmental change necessitates a new approach to lotic bioassessment. Although biotic indices are widely accepted by regulatory authorities they are labor intensive to develop and biogeographically restricted in application. While trait-based assessment circumvents these problems, difficulties associated with non-discrete responses to stressors, less robust metric formulation (e.g. {\%} abundance) and complications of the trait syndrome limit its potential uptake. We assumed that trait combinations, within the syndrome, would effectively represent synergistic, antagonistic and null interactions with respect to stress sensitivity. Applying this principle of positive and negative complementarity we constructed indicator scores for macroinvertebrate families for the complex stressor of organic pollution based on potentially relevant traits: respiration, habit, trophic class, flow preference, thermal preference, size and activity/mobility. We compared trait-derived sensitivity scores to empirically-derived scores from three versions of a biotic index: the BMWP, a statistically-based revision of the BMWP (s-BMWP) and the BMWP modified for the Iberian Peninsula (IBMWP). Trait-derived sensitivity scores were significantly correlated with empirical sensitivity scores: IBMWP {\textgreater} s-BMWP {\textgreater} BMWP. Despite the overall good correspondence, trait-derived scores tended to be consistently underestimated for Heteroptera, Odonata and Ephemeroptera in comparison with BMWP scores. Conversely sensitivity scores for Hirudinea and Gastropoda tended to be overestimated. While revision of the composite trait algorithm could, in some cases, improve these disparities they also indicate the importance of evolution and phylogeny in determining organism sensitivity to river pollution. Despite the potentially contentious issues of trait selection and trait weighting, the concept of trait complementarity is arguably more scientifically justifiable than regarding traits as isolated entities. It may offer the most pragmatic means to elaborate biotic indices where empirical methods are problematic. The subsequent ability to deconstruct sensitivity scores to verify their appropriateness would greatly facilitating moves towards harmonized assessment. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human infrastructures can modify ecosystems, thereby affecting the occurrence and spatial distribution of organisms, as well as ecosystem functionality. Sustainable development requires the ability to predict responses of species to anthropogenic pressures. We investigated the large scale, long term effect of important human alterations of benthic habitats with an integrated approach combining engineering and ecological modelling. We focused our analysis on the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands), which was partially embanked by a storm surge barrier (Oosterscheldekering, 1986). We made use of 1) a prognostic (numerical) environmental (hydrodynamic) model and 2) a novel application of quantile regression to Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) to simulate both the realized and potential (habitat suitability) abundance of four macrozoobenthic species: Scoloplos armiger, Peringia ulvae, Cerastoderma edule and Lanice conchilega. The analysis shows that part of the fluctuations in macrozoobenthic biomass stocks during the last decades is related to the effect of the coastal defense infrastructures on the basin morphology and hydrodynamics. The methodological framework we propose is particularly suitable for the analysis of large abundance datasets combined with high-resolution environmental data. Our analysis provides useful information on future changes in ecosystem functionality induced by human activities.},

abstract = {1. High-gradient mountain streams are ideal for studying longitudinal biological patterns, although the degree of similarity in the biological gradient among physically similar streams in a region is poorly known. Our first objective was to evaluate variability in benthic communities along four streams in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We analysed the relative influence of longitudinal position versus reach-scale physical variables on community structure and measured community similarity at comparable longitudinal positions on the four streams. 2. Our second objective was to evaluate the relative utility of taxonomically versus functionally defined communities to characterise assemblage structure: are taxonomic patterns more predictable along the gradient than are patterns of ecologically important species traits? 3. Redundancy analyses (RDA), including measures of both reach-scale environmental variables (substratum properties, periphytic cover, local channel slope) and longitudinal position (altitude, stream size), confirmed that the longitudinal position of a site was most important in determining taxonomic composition. Functional community structure was also influenced by longitudinal position, but reach-scale variables (especially periphyton and median particle size) were of greater importance. 4. Redundancy analyses explained 29.3{\%} of total taxonomic variance and 26.0{\%} of functional variance, indicating that defining assemblages functionally provides no greater understanding of community patterns given several known environmental variables. Strict longitudinal limits of taxa, the presumably identical regional species pool across our sites, and/or trade-offs among different types of species traits probably explain this result. 5. Redundancy analyses did suggest, however, that traits related to longer life (semivoltinism, long-lived adults, and slow larval development) were more common downstream, while long-distance dispersal ability and high fecundity were associated with higher altitude and its associated harsher conditions. 6. When sampling sites were grouped into three ecological zones defined by altitude, mean community similarity (measured both taxonomically and functionally) was lowest across streams at the highest altitude. This pattern could be driven by increased insularity of alpine-zone streams, resulting from a combination of harsh terrestrial environment, lack of hydrological connectivity, and limited species ranges along the longitudinal continuum.},

abstract = {Identifying and quantifying relationships among landscape patterns, anthropogenic distur- bances, and aquatic ecosystems is a new and rapidly developing approach to riverine ecology. In this review, we begin by describing the policy and management drivers for landscape-scale riverine research and we synthesize the technological advances that have enabled dramatic progress in the field. We then describe the development of landscape-scale riverine research through a series of landmark theoretical and review papers. Focusing on landscape-fish rela- tionships, we consider the degree to which past efforts have been successful at meeting three key challenges: (1) Has new research effectively incorporated the strengths of new technologies or are we doing the same old thing with more expensive data? (2) Have we incorporated key concepts from landscape ecology to improve our understanding of how landscapes affect rivers? (3) Have we been able to use landscape analyses to address management and policy needs? We conclude with a review of opportunities for advancement in the field of landscape-scale riverine research. These include moving toward the development of mechanistic theories of how landscapes affect rivers across disparate regions; considering the spatio-temporal struc- ture of human impacts to landscapes; harnessing new statistical tools; and carefully defining landscape and response metrics to capture specific features.},

abstract = {The importance of the surrounding landscape to aquatic ecosystems has been well established. Most research linking aquatic ecosystems to landscapes has focused on the one-way effect of land on water. However, to understand fully the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems must be seen not only as receptors of human modification of the landscape, but also as potential drivers of these modifications. We hypothesized that the presence of aquatic ecosystems influences the spatial distribution of human land use/cover of the nearby landscape ({\textless}/=1 km) and that this influence has changed through time from the 1930s to the 1990s. To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of residential, agricultural, and forested land use/cover around aquatic ecosystems (lakes, wetlands, and streams) to the overall regional land use/cover proportion in an area in southeast Michigan, USA; we also compared the distribution of land use/cover around county roads/highway and towns (known determinants of many land use/cover patterns) to the regional proportion. We found that lakes, wetlands, and streams were strongly associated with the distribution of land use/cover, that each ecosystem type showed different patterns, and that the magnitude of the association was at least as strong as the association with human features. We also found that the area closest to aquatic ecosystems ({\textless}500 m) was more strongly associated with land use/cover distribution than areas further away. Finally, we found that the strength of the association between aquatic ecosystems and land use/cover increased from 1938 to 1995, although the overall patterns were similar through time. Our results show that a more complete understanding is needed of the role of aquatic ecosystems on the distribution of land use/cover.},

The model is constructed using object-oriented metric data in Li and Henry's datasets, which were collected from two different object-oriented systems. Prediction accuracy of the model is evaluated and compared with commonly used regression-based models. The results suggest that the Bayesian network model can predict maintainability more accurately than the regression-based models for one system, and almost as accurately as the best regression-based model for the other system. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {P{\textgreater} We analysed a large number of concurrent samples of macroinvertebrate communities and chemical indicators of eutrophication and organic pollution [total-P, total-N, NH4-N, biological oxygen demand (BOD5)] from 594 Danish stream sites. Samples were taken over an 11-year time span as part of the Danish monitoring programme on the aquatic environment. Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled in spring using a standardised kick-sampling procedure whereas chemical variables were sampled six to 24 times per year per site. Habitat variables were assessed once when macroinvertebrates were sampled. The plecopteran Leuctra showed a significant negative exponential relationship (r2 = 0.90) with BOD5 and occurred at only 16{\%} of the sites with BOD5 above 1.6 mg L-1. Sharp declines with increasing BOD5 levels were found for the trichopteran families Sericostomatidae and Glossosomatidae although they appeared to be slightly less sensitive than Leuctra. Other plecopterans such as Isoperla showed a similar type of response curve to Leuctra (negative exponential) but occurred at sites with relatively high concentrations of BOD5 up to 3-4 mg L-1. In contrast, the response curve of the isopod Asellus aquaticus followed a saturation function reaching a plateau above 3-4 mg L-1 BOD5 and the dipteran Chironomus showed an exponential increase in occurrence with increasing BOD5 concentration. Macroinvertebrate occurrence appeared to be related primarily to concentrations of BOD5, NH4-N and total-P whereas there were almost no relationships to total-N. Occurrence of a number of taxa showed a stronger relationship to habitat conditions (width and substrate) than chemical variables. Important macroinvertebrate taxa are reduced at concentrations of BOD5 that are normally perceived as indicating unimpacted stream site conditions. Our results confirmed sensitivity/tolerance patterns used by existing bioassessment systems only to some degree.},

@article{Sheaves2014,
abstract = {Tropical fisheries are in decline around world as a result of diverse anthropogenic threats. These threats are intimately linked to biodiversity and conservation values because of the heavy dependence of both fisheries and high value marine and coastal wetlands on coastal ecosystem health. Consequently, if the widespread degradation of coastal ecosystems can be halted and remediated, there are substantial benefits to fisheries output, ecosystem resilience, food security, livelihoods, recreation and the protection of ecological assets of national and global significance. The extent, intactness and quality of Australia[U+05F3]s tropical coastal ecosystems has declined markedly since European settlement, due to the cumulative impact of many small encroachments and local barrier construction on the extent and productivity of coastal wetlands, mangroves and seagrass meadows. Additionally, coastal ecosystem dependent biota has been excluded from large areas of critical habitats. Despite these changes, coastal fisheries show no clear declines that could not be explained by changes in effort. This lack of detectable decline is probably partly attributable to the short history of available fisheries catch data. However, it is also likely that it reflects the offsetting of lost natural productivity by greatly increased anthropogenic nutrient loads; a substantial problem as governments are committed to large scale, long term efforts to reduce discharges of nutrients to coastal waters. This possibility underlines the importance of rejuvenating lost coastal productivity. Evaluation of past remediation efforts show that documented success is rare, due to a complex of factors including ineffective prioritisation, a lack of necessary knowledge and resources, and inefficient monitoring and evaluation. Past experiences from Australia[U+05F3]s tropics and around the world, together with current ecological understanding, suggests some generally desirable characteristics to enhance the likelihood of successful remediation and repair actions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We reviewed 219 papers and built an inventory of 532 items of ecological evidence on multiple stressor impacts in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, as well as groundwaters. Our review revealed that, despite the existence of a huge conceptual knowledge base in aquatic ecology, few studies actually provide quantitative evidence on multi-stress effects. Nutrient stress was involved in 71{\%} to 98{\%} of multi-stress situations in the three types of surface water environments, and in 42{\%} of those in groundwaters. However, their impact manifested differently along the groundwater-river-lake-transitional-coastal continuum, mainly determined by the different hydro-morphological features of these ecosystems. The reviewed papers addressed two-stressor combinations most frequently (42{\%}), corresponding with the actual status-quo of pressures acting on European surface waters as reported by the Member States in the WISE WFD Database (EEA, 2015). Across all biological groups analysed, higher explanatory power of the stress-effect models was discernible for lakes under multi-stressor compared to single stressor conditions, but generally lower for coastal and transitional waters. Across all aquatic environments, the explanatory power of stress-effect models for fish increased when multi-stressor conditions were taken into account in the analysis, qualifying this organism group as a useful indicator of multi-stress effects. In contrast, the explanatory power of models using benthic flora decreased under conditions of multiple stress.},

abstract = {Catchment managers face considerable challenges in managing ecological assets. This task is made difficult by the variable and complex nature of ecological assets, and the considerable uncertainty involved in quantifying how various threats and hazards impact upon them. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address the modelling needs of environmental management. However, to date many Bayesian networks (Bn) developed for environmental management have been parameterised using knowledge elicitation only. Not only are these models highly qualitative, but the time and effort involved in elicitation of a complex Bn can often be overwhelming. Unfortunately in environmental applications, data alone are often too limited for parameterising a Bn. Consequently, there is growing interest in how to parameterise Bns using both data and elicited information. At present, there is little formal guidance on how to combine what can be learned from the data with what can be elicited. In a previous publication we proposed a detailed methodology for this process, focussing on parameterising and evaluating a Bn. In this paper, we further develop this methodology using a risk assessment case study, with the focus being on native fish communities in the Goulburn Catchment (Victoria, Australia). ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Pesticides and deposited fine sediment have independently been associated with changes in relative abundance and species richness in aquatic ecosystems, but the interplay between these two stressors in agricultural streams is poorly understood. A 28-day experiment in outdoor stream mesocosms examined the effects of four levels each of fine sediment coverage (0, 25, 75, 100{\%}) and glyphosate-based herbicide concentration (0, 50, 200, 370$\mu$g/L) on periphyton communities (algae and bacteria) in a fully factorial, repeated-measures design. Our aims were to determine whether (i) increased levels of sediment and glyphosate had individual and/or additive effects, (ii) increased sediment reduced the toxicity of glyphosate (antagonistic multiple stressor interaction), or (iii) sediment-adsorbed glyphosate prolonged the effects of exposure (synergistic interaction). We also assigned all algal taxa to three ecological guilds (low-profile, high-profile and motile growth forms) and separately determined their responses to the treatments. As individual stressors, sediment addition affected all algal community-level metrics, whereas glyphosate addition only affected algal community evenness. Bacterial taxon richness was unaffected by either stressor. In combination, however, significant overall sediment by glyphosate interactions were detected, demonstrating synergistic (algal evenness, high-profile and motile guilds) or antagonistic effects (low-profile guild). Our experiment underscores the importance of considering both structural and functional indicators, including algal guild representation, when assessing the mechanisms by which periphyton communities respond to multiple stressors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Anthropogenic activities can increase fine sediment supply to streams over multiple spatial and temporal extents. Identifying the processes responsible, and the scale at which any effects on stream organisms become evident, are key management needs, but appropriately scaled surveys are surprisingly few. 2. We surveyed macroinvertebrates and superficial fine sediments at two spatial resolutions (reach- and patch-scale) in tributaries of the River Usk, a temperate, montane catchment in rural Wales (U.K.). Land use, habitat and geomorphological character were measured on-site or derived from an existing database (=Fluvial Audit). We aimed to identify: (i) how in-stream sediments varied with land use and associated geomorphology; (ii) likely consequences for macroinvertebrates and (iii) any scale-dependence in relationships between macroinvertebrates and sediment character. 3. At both the reach- and patch-scales, bed cover by fine sediment was related directly to the extent of eroding banks 500 m upstream. In turn, sedimentation and bank erosion were negatively correlated with catchment or riparian woodland extent. 4. At the reach scale, macroinvertebrate composition varied with catchment land use and stream chemistry, with richness declining as rough grazing or woodland was replaced by improved grassland. There was no response to deposited sediment except for weak increase in the relative abundance of oligochaetes. 5. By contrast, at the patch scale, fine sediments were accompanied by pronounced changes in invertebrate composition, and we ranked the 27 most common taxa according to their apparent sediment tolerance. General estimating equations showed that total and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness decreased significantly by 20{\%} and 25{\%} at the most sediment impacted sites (30{\%} cover) by comparison with sediment-free sites. 6. We conclude that sediment deposition in the upper Usk system mostly reflects local bank erosion, with riparian woodland likely to mediate this process through bank stability. Fine sediment release had marked ecological effects, but these were detectable only at patch-to-patch scales. We suggest that investigation of localized sediment release in streams will benefit from scale-dependent or scale-specific sampling, and some effects could go undetected unless sample resolution is selected carefully.},

abstract = {1. Inferring effects of environmental flows is difficult with standard statistical approaches because flow-delivery programs are characterised by weak experimental design, and monitoring programs often have insufficient replication to detect ecologically significant effects. Bayesian hierarchical approaches may be more suited to the task, as they are more flexible and allow data from multiple non-replicate sampling units (e.g. rivers) to be combined, increasing inferential strength.$\backslash$n2. We assessed the utility of Bayesian hierarchical models for detecting ecological effects of flow variation by conducting both hierarchical and non-hierarchical analyses on two environmental endpoints. We analysed effects of discharge on salinity in the Wimmera and Glenelg rivers (Victoria, Australia) using a linear regression with autocorrelation terms, and on Australian smelt in the Thomson River (Victoria, Australia) using a multi- level covariate model. These analyses test some of the hypotheses upon which environmental flow recommendations have been made for these rivers.$\backslash$n3. Discharge was correlated with reduced salinity at six of 10 sites, but with increased salinity at two others. The results were very similar for hierarchical and non-hierarchical models. For Australian smelt, the hierarchical model found some evidence that excess summer discharge reduces abundance in all river reaches, but the non-hierarchical model was able to detect this response in only one reach.$\backslash$n4. The results highlight the power and flexibility of Bayesian analysis. Neither of the models fitted would have been amenable to more widely used statistical approaches, and it is unlikely that we would have detected responses to flow variation in these data had we been using such techniques. Hierarchical models can greatly improve inferential strength in the data-poor situations that are common in ecological monitoring, and will be able to be used to assess the effectiveness of environmental flow programs and maximise the benefits of large-scale environmental flow monitoring programs.},

abstract = {The volume of primary literature in conservation and environmental science is expanding rapidly. Evidence syntheses that review and combine the findings from research on policy-relevant questions are therefore vital for informing decision-making. However, such syntheses exhibit considerable variation in conduct and reporting, potentially undermining their value to decision-makers. To address this problem, we developed a scoring system - the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT) - that uses detailed criteria and guidelines to evaluate policy-relevant syntheses in conservation and environmental science. The higher the score awarded, the greater the objectivity, comprehensiveness and transparency of the synthesis, hence the greater the confidence in its reliability. We then used 40 review articles to test CEESAT in terms of (i) applicability to different syntheses, (ii) validity of scores awarded, (iii) effectiveness at discriminating between syntheses, and (iv) repeatability of scoring by different assessors. CEESAT was applicable to 36 articles, and scores ranged from 1 to 33 (mean=13.2, median=15, maximum possible=39). Variation in overall scores and in the individual criteria shows that CEESAT discriminates effectively among syntheses, making differences in rigour clear. Scoring was repeatable, indicating that assessments are not overly susceptible to differences in the application and interpretation of guidelines. The detailed rationale and guidelines for each criterion should help improve future syntheses and promote consistent scoring between assessors. Furthermore, scores can be used directly by non-specialists to compare syntheses that investigate key conservation questions and to incorporate reliability and rigour into decision-making. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Townsend2004,
abstract = {Land-use studies are challenging because of the difficulty of finding catchments that can be used as replicates and because land-use effects may be obscured by sources of variance acting over spatial scales smaller than the catchment. To determine the extent to which land-use effects on stream ecosystems are scale dependent, we designed a whole- catchment study of six matched pairs (pasture versus native tussock) of second-order stream catchments, taking replicate samples from replicate bedforms (pools and riffles) in each stream. 2. Pasture streams had a smaller representation of endemic riparian plant species, particularly tussock grasses, higher bank erosion, a somewhat deeper layer of fine sediment, lower water velocities in riffles, less moss cover and higher macroinvertebrate biodiversity. At the bedform scale, suspendable inorganic sediment (SIS) was higher in pools than riffles and in pasture streams there was a negative relationship between SIS and the percentage of the bed free of overhanging vegetation. Differences between stream reaches (including any interactions between land use and stream pair) were significant for SIS, substrate depth and characteristics of riparian vegetation. There were also significant differences between replicate bedforms in the same stream reaches in percentage exotic species in overhanging vegetation, percentage moss cover, QMCI (Quantitative Macroin- vertebrate Community Index â a macroinvertebrate-based stream health index) and macroinvertebrate density. 3. Significant differences among stream reaches and among replicate bedform units within the same reach, as well as interactions between these spatial units and land-use effects, are neither trivial nor ânoise' but represent real differences among spatial units that typically are unaccounted for in stream studies. Our multi-scale study design, accompanied by an investigation of the explanatory power of different factors operating at different scales, provides an improved understanding of variability in nature.},

abstract = {Rivers are complex systems for which it is hard to make reliable assessments of causes and responses to impairments. We present a holistic risk-based framework for river ecosystem assessment integrating all potential intervening processes and functions. Risk approaches allow us to deal with uncertainty both in the construction of indicators for magnitude of stressors and in the inference of environmental processes and their impairment. Yet, here we go further than simply replacing uncertainty by a risk factor. We introduce a more accurate and rigorous notion of risk with a transcription of uncertainty in causal relationships in probability distributions for the magnitude of impairment and the weight of different descriptors, with an associated confidence in the diagnostic. We discuss how Bayesian belief networks and Bayesian hierarchical inference allow us to deal with this risk concept to predict impairments and potential recovery of river ecosystems. We developed a comprehensive approach for river ecosystem assessment, which offers an appealing tool to facilitate diagnosis of the likely causes of impairment and predict future conditions. The ability of the risk approaches to integrate multi-scale quantitative and qualitative descriptors in the identification of multiple stressor sources and pathways in the stream network, and their impairment of specific processes and structures is illustrated for the national-level risk analysis for hydromorphology and pesticide pollution. Not only does the risk-based framework provide a more complete picture of environmental impairments, but it also offers a comprehensive, user-friendly tool to instruct the decision process.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to develop and apply several simple and rough indicators for river aquatic ecosystems assessment in order to screen potential chemical stressors. Several indicators, based on toxicity (PNEC) and on legislation levels (EQS) have been developed. All these indicators are ratios that were calculated by using public and private data of concentrations of a large list of compounds during a period of five years, including metals and organic compounds in the lower part of the Llobregat river basin at the intake of the drinking water treatment plant. Additionally, new campaigns were executed for increasing the information available on the presence of compounds not routinely analyzed, such as some other pesticides and pharmaceuticals. In the case of inorganic pollutants, the indicators obtained in this river section showed significant risk especially for zinc, but also for copper, nickel and barium. For organic pollutants, the pesticides terbuthylazine, diazinon, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic (MCPA), and in a few cases, chlorpyrifos and lindane, also showed indexes above the threshold. Among the pharmaceuticals, the antibiotics clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin were the only ones with risk indicators adverse to ecosystems. The specific values of the indexes obtained rely on the quantity and quality of the data available, so their interpretation should take into account that some values can be high due to the use of too conservative toxicological information.},

abstract = {Transferable discharge permit (TDP) programs show potential cost-effective methods of pollution control in river systems. Nevertheless, there remain uncertainties that, if not adequately addressed, might impair their success. Trading Ratio System (TRS) suggested by Hung and Shaw [2005. A trading-ratio system for trading water pollution discharge permits. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 49, 83-102] is a cost-effective tool for water quality management in river systems, which provides the optimum trading pattern among dischargers. TRS has been designed for a single conservative water quality variable and the existing uncertainties are not incorporated. In this study, TRS is extended to be applicable to Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) management in river systems and uncertainties in input variables of river water quality simulation model are also considered. In the proposed methodology, low water quality is also quantified as a fuzzy event and fuzzy risk of violating the water quality standards is estimated at each checkpoint along the river. The Extended Trading Ratio System (ETRS) is used in a Monte Carlo Analysis to provide the required data for training and validating a Bayesian Network (BN). The trained BN can be used for real time river water quality management and provides the probability density functions of treatment levels and trading discharge permit policies. The methodology is successfully applied to the Zarjub River in the northern part of Iran to show its usefulness as a cost-effective and risk-informed decision-making tool in real time river water quality management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The influence of land use on water quality in streams is scale-dependent and varies in time and space. In this study, land cover patterns and stocking rates were used as measures of agricultural development in two pasture and one native grassland catchment in New Zealand and were related to water quality in streams of various orders. The amount of pasture per subcatchment correlated well to total nitrogen and nitrate in one catchment and turbidity and total phosphorous in the other catchment. Stocking rates were only correlated to total phosphorous in one pasture catchment but showed stronger correlations to ammonium, total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the other pasture catchment. Winter and spring floods were significant sources of nutrients and faecal coliforms from one of the pasture catchments into a wetland complex. Nutrient and faecal coliform concentrations were better predicted by pastural land cover in fourth-order than in second-order streams. This suggests that upstream land use is more influential in larger streams, while local land use and other factors may be more important in smaller streams. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes need to be scale-sensitive. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Demars2009,
abstract = {A brief summary of the historical developments relating to plant distribution and aquatic macrophyte-nutrient indices provided a means of assessing the general context and validity of previous assumptions. This has particular current relevance because of the prominent use of bioindicators for defining nutrient enrichment. A survey of 161 sites distributed across two broadly contrasting groups of rivers (circum-neutral versus alkaline) recorded 110 species of aquatic macrophytes and these have been statistically analyzed to (i) rank and separate the individual effects of local environmental conditions and spatial isolation on species distribution in the two contrasting groups of sites; (ii) calculate a macrophyte index based on plant cover and species indicator values (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR); and finally (iii) investigate the implications for biomonitoring. Chemical, physical and hydrological site attributes together with spatial isolation, each explained a significant and at least partially independent influence over plant species distribution. It was extremely difficult, however, to separate the single effects of different site attributes on plant distribution. While some plant species are more restricted to certain environmental conditions, many appeared indifferent to the range of those being tested. The role played by nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) were either mostly indistinguishable from other site attributes (e.g., nitrate from conductivity) or subordinate (e.g., soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium). It is therefore very unlikely that macrophyte species composition could provide a reliable bioindicator of the surrounding nutrient (N, P) status. The calculation of the plant index illustrated this unreliability by showing that strong correlations existed with many environmental variables, not just inorganic N and P.},

abstract = {Despite awareness that disease emergence may be related to ecological change, few studies have rigorously analyzed the underlying environmental drivers of the dynamics of disease emergence. This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied. Here, we outline some of the barriers to advancing our understanding of causation in disease ecology and offer some solutions for investigating large-scale ecological drivers, such as global warming, pollution, and land-use change.},

@article{Darroch1997,
abstract = {In epidemiologic studies of two binary exposure factors, much attention has been given to the concept of synergism of the factors. The leading dictionary of epidemiology offers two definitions of synergism, one of which this author labels statistical and the other biologic. The epidemiologic literature has been largely concerned with statistical synergism, which is typically measured using additive or multiplicative interaction. This paper focuses on biologic synergism, on the related concept of biologic parallelism, and on the question of how much information can be gleaned about population amounts of biologic synergism and parallelism--information which is of vital interest to epidemiologists. A fundamental identity equates the difference between the amounts of biologic synergism and parallelism to the additive interaction. Two biologic models, the multistage model and the no-hit or immunity model, enhance the interpretation of multiplicative interaction as a measure of statistical synergism, but it is pointed out here that, unfortunately, both models incorporate the strong assumption that there is no parallelism. A third model, the single-hit or vulnerability model, makes the even stronger assumption that there is no biologic synergism and consequently that the additive interaction is equal to minus the amount of parallelism. A consequence of this fact is that a link which has been perceived in the literature to exist between the single-hit model and the additive interaction is false.},

abstract = {Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled (seven Surber samples per site) in 88 rivers throughout New Zealand in "runs" (velocity 0.4-0.8 m s-1, depth = 0.3-0.6 m), under autumn baseflow conditions (Q lt median). Medians and 10-90 percentiles for the following community level characteristics were: taxa richness, 14 and 7-20:0.7 m-2); Shannon Diversity (H'), 1.33 and 0.80-1.90; total density, 1900 and 230-6700 m-2; and total biomass, 0.608 and 0.112-2.932 g AFDW m-2. Invertebrate abundance and taxonomic richness were lowest in rivers with beds of silt or sand, or cobbles overlain with sand deposits. Comparisons of environmental factors between sites grouped by TWINSPAN indicated that the degree of catchment development to improved pasture, water temperature, and level of enrichment (indicated by increased nutrients and periphyton biomass) are important factors affecting invertebrate community structure in New Zealand rivers. Mayflies, stoneflies, and predatory caddisflies associated with cooler, less enriched, steeper, and more elevated sites than snails, crustaceans, chironomids, and worms. Stonefly biomass was minimal at sites having mean annual temperatures gt 13 degree C. The following community characteristics emerged as useful indicators of the level of water enrichment: the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI) and its quantitative analog (QMCI); the presence of some species (e.g., Zelandoperla decorata and Bereoptera roria), and the densities of some widely distributed taxa (e.g., Deleatidium spp. and Psilochorema spp.); percentage predator biomasss; and the number of ephemeropteran, plecopteran, and trichopeteran taxa (EPT). Sites did not separate out clearly into ecoregions, although rivers with "clean-water" faunas were more predominant in the South Island than in the North Island. This is though to reflect the greater degree of development of the North Island catchments},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the geomorphic complexity and wide range of hydrologic regimes found in alpine headwater channels that provide complex habitats for aquatic taxa. These geohydrologic elements are fundamental to better understand patterns in species assemblages and indicator taxa and are necessary to aquatic monitoring protocols that aim to track changes in physical conditions. Complex physical variables shape many biological and ecological traits, including life history strategies, but these mechanisms can only be understood if critical physical variables are adequately represented within the sampling framework. To better align sampling design protocols with current geohydrologic knowledge, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates regional-scale conditions, basin-scale longitudinal profiles, valley-scale glacial macroform structure, valley segment-scale (i.e., colluvial, alluvial, and bedrock), and reach-scale channel types. At the valley segment- and reach-scales, these hierarchical levels are associated with differences in streamflow and sediment regime, water source contribution and water temperature. Examples of linked physical-ecological hypotheses placed in a landscape context and a case study using the proposed framework are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for monitoring complex temporal and spatial patterns and processes in glaciated basins. This approach is meant to aid in comparisons between mountain regions on a global scale and to improve management of potentially endangered alpine species affected by climate change and other stressors.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Biological traits are increasingly used for describing ecological functioning of stream benthic assem-blages. Such approaches associate information on species distribution to their biological characteristics (e.g. life history, physiology, dispersal ability) providing a biological trait profile of communities. They may complement structural bioassessment measures using taxonomic composition by providing indirect information on stream ecological functioning, with the additional advantage of being less constrained by biogeographic differences. A multivariate predictive model, that provides a site-specific list of expected taxa at least disturbed conditions was recently developed for the bioassessment of Portuguese streams. Here, we tested if the inclusion of trait information in the model would also enable the detection of most common anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., organic contamination, hydrological disturbance) and provide diagnostic hints for causal relationships. We used existing information on 11 invertebrate biological traits and their 54 categories to convert the observed and expected taxonomic composition at several test sites into expected and observed trait compositions. The first three axes of a normalised PCA (Principal Components Analysis) performed on disturbance variables accounted for 42.7{\%} of explained variability. The proportion of variance in distur-bance explained by the three types of trait-based metrics (overall observed/expected trait composition, trait-category profile difference and traits profile dissimilarity) ranged between 9{\%} and 32{\%}. Our pre-dictions made on the response of observed to expected trait categories for organic contamination were generally confirmed and demonstrated that disturbances resulted in a change in those traits conferring species resilience capacity and sensitivity to oxygen depletion, as well as a shift in the proportion of ani-mals with filter-feeding behaviour. Variations in observed to expected trait-category differences showed that even a small increase in organic contamination led to a significant change in the biological trait profile, as expected. By contrast, only two out of 11 trait category predictions were confirmed for hydro-logical disturbance. Finally, we found that 4/11 and 9/11 observed to expected trait differences showed a significant deviation with organic contamination and hydrological disturbance, respectively, whereas all 11 observed to expected trait differences responded to overall disturbance. These changes in trait profiles reflect changes in the performance of invertebrate communities to cope with disturbance, which potentially can alter ecosystem functioning (e.g., energy flow or chemical cycling). In conclusion, the integration of biological trait information in an AUSRIVAS type predictive model allowed the detection of a general disturbance gradient and particularly organic contamination, which indicates their value in addition to taxonomic-based assessment.},

abstract = {1. Naturally variable river flows are considered to be important for structuring riparian vegetation. However, while the importance of floods for the ecology of riparian vegetation is well recognised, much less is known about the importance of small fluctuations in river flows. 2. We investigated the effect of water supply diversion weirs on the riparian vegetation of upland streams. These weirs remove within-channel fluctuations in flow but do not prevent large floods downstream. We surveyed the in-channel and banktop vegetation of five streams, three of which were regulated by weirs and two of which acted as controls. 3. Unexpectedly, we observed greater species richness within the channel downstream of the weirs. This was because of increased numbers of exotic and terrestrial (âdry') plant species. Grass cover was also greater downstream of the weirs. There were no significant differences in the banktop vegetation between the upstream and downstream sites of the regulated streams. 4. Our results highlight the role of within-channel flow variability in maintaining the composition of vegetation within the stream channel. We suggest that greater species richness does not necessarily indicate a less-disturbed environment. Rather, a greater number of âdry' species is indicative of the impacts of flow regulation. 5. Small fluctuations in river flows are probably necessary to protect the ecosystem structure and function of regulated streams. It is recommended that variable within- channel flows be provided in regulated streams.},

@article{Lancaster2006,
abstract = {1. In many ecosystems, the local abundance of organisms is spatially heterogeneous. Ecologists often seek to explain this variation by modelling the central tendency of abundance as a function of a single dominant factor (central response, CR). An alternative approach is to model maximum and minimum abundance in relation to the dominant factor (limiting response, LR), thereby acknowledging that multiple factors may constrain abundance and create scatter in the relationship. In many ecosystems, including streams, abundanceâenvironment relationships are traditionally expected to be CR models with a single dominant factor determining local abundance, but this hypothesis lacks rigorous test. This omission is of concern because CR modelled relationships form the foundations of many ecological tests, predictive and management tools that, consequently, may provide erroneous interpre- tations. 2. In a survey designed to minimise variance in the data, we related densities of three taxa of stream invertebrates to near-bed flow. Data were analysed using both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and quantile regression, which have different characteristic results depending on whether the relationship is better described as a CR or LR model. For all three taxa, invertebrate responses to flow conformed most closely to LR models and were best described by quantile regression, although OLS regression revealed broadly similar general trends in this case. 3. Based on the statistically modelled relationships, we were able to hypothesise which ecological mechanisms limited maximum abundance at this site, including dislodgement with high flow (Heptageniidae, Leuctridae), reduced oxygen uptake at low flow (Baetidae) and reduced provision of interstitial spaces at high flow (Leuctridae). Scatter in the relationships was attributable to multiple factors that may operate at different scales,},

@article{Ward2009a,
abstract = {As noted by Wesley Salmon and many others, causal concepts are ubiquitous in every branch of theoretical science, in the practical disciplines and in everyday life. In the theoretical and practical sciences especially, people often base claims about causal relations on applications of statistical methods to data. However, the source and type of data place important constraints on the choice of statistical methods as well as on the warrant attributed to the causal claims based on the use of such methods. For example, much of the data used by people interested in making causal claims come from non-experimental, observational studies in which random allocations to treatment and control groups are not present. Thus, one of the most important problems in the social and health sciences concerns making justified causal inferences using non-experimental, observational data. In this paper, I examine one method of justifying such inferences that is especially widespread in epidemiology and the health sciences generally - the use of causal criteria. I argue that while the use of causal criteria is not appropriate for either deductive or inductive inferences, they do have an important role to play in inferences to the best explanation. As such, causal criteria, exemplified by what Bradford Hill referred to as "aspects of [statistical] associations", have an indispensible part to play in the goal of making justified causal claims.},

abstract = {1. Current budgets for environmental management are high, tend to increase, and are used to support policy and legislation which is standardized for large geographic units. Therefore, the search for tools to monitor the effects of this investment is a major issue in applied ecology. Ideally, such a biomonitoring tool should: (1) be as general as possible with respect to its geographic application; (2) be as specific as possible by separating different types of human impact on a given ecosystem; (3) reliably indicate changes in human impact of a particular type; and (4) be derived from a sound theoretical concept in ecology. 2. We developed an approach to biomonitoring which matches these 'ideal' characteristics by focusing on numerous, general biological species traits (e.g. size, number of descendants per reproductive cycle, parental care, mobility) and on the habitat templet concept, which relates trends in these general species traits to disturbance patterns. Using the French Rhone River and benthic macroinvertebrates as an example, we have used the data to demonstrate a general framework and the potential of our approach rather than to produce a ready-made tool. Our data covered a large river and its major tributaries, which has a catchment that crosses ecoregions, and known gradients and discontinuities in human impact. 3. We applied multivariate analyses to evaluate how the distribution of species traits in invertebrate communities could discriminate environmental differences along the Rhone in comparison to traditionally used approaches (e.g. community structure, based on species abundances, or ecological species traits, such as velocity preferences and pollution tolerance). Invertebrate community structure expressed in terms either of the abundance or the traits of species reliably indicated differences in overall human impact. The community structure based on biological traits was less confounded by natural spatial gradients and reliably indicated human impact, while community structure based on ecological traits was the most confounded by natural spatial gradients and was the poorest indicator of human impact. Community structure based on species abundances was an intermediate indicator of human impact. 4. These results indicate that a revision of biomonitoring approaches which have been based on a single aspect of the biological responses may be warranted. The biological traits of species could separate the different types of human impact. Therefore, the use of these traits in biomonitoring could improve existing multi-metric approaches. Future research has to show if the general applicability of species traits allows the development of a unique biomonitoring tool for running waters of the European Union, for running waters in temperate climates on several continents, for freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems, and/or for global biodiversity assessment.},

This study explores the potential distribution of brown trout by a species distribution modelling approach for Iran. Furthermore, modelling results are compared to the distribution described in the literature. Areas outside the currently known distribution which may offer potential habitats for brown trout are identified. The species distribution modelling was based on five different modelling techniques: Generalised Linear Model, Generalised Additive Model, Generalised Boosting Model, Classification Tree Analysis and Random Forests, which are finally summarised in an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered four environmental descriptors at the local scale (slope, bankfull width, wetted width, and elevation) and three climatic parameters (mean air temperature, range of air temperature and annual precipitation) which were extracted on three different spatial extents (1/5/10 km). The performance of all models was excellent (â¥0.8) according to the TSS (True Skill Statistic) criterion. Slope, mean and range of air temperature were the most important variables in predicting brown trout occurrence. Presented results deepen the knowledge about distribution patterns of brown trout in Iran. Moreover, this study gives a basic background for the future development of assessment methods for riverine ecosystems in Iran.},

abstract = {Most river restoration projects have applied relatively small-scale measures focused on improving specific instream conditions, with only limited outcomes for biodiversity in rivers and their adjacent riparian habitats. Here, we investigate the effects of both small- and large-scale restoration projects on floodplain vegetation across 20 European catchments. We focused on the roles of different restoration parameters (i.e., the number, spatial extent and type of restoration measure applied and restoration age) and specific environmental characteristics in regulating changes in plant diversity and trait composition following restoration. Among restoration characteristics, restoration type was the only significant determinant of plant community responses, with stream channel widening having the strongest effects, particularly on the diversity and composition of species traits favoured by increases in physical disturbance (e.g. flooding) and open habitat patch availability (e.g. plant growth form, life strategy and life span). Of the environmental variables, altitude and discharge were positively and most strongly related to responses of both species and trait diversity. Our results emphasise the value of (i) choosing relevant restoration measures that affect environmental conditions of importance for the target organism group and (ii) conducting restoration projects in environmental settings where the likelihood of restoration âsuccessâ is maximised.},

abstract = {Objective: The Bradford Hill criteria are the best available criteria for causal inference. However, there is no information on how the criteria should be weighed and they cannot be combined into one probability estimate for causality. Our objective is to provide an empirical basis for weighing the Bradford Hill criteria and to develop a transparent method to estimate the probability for causality. Study Design and Setting: All 159 agents classified by International Agency for Research of Cancer as category 1 or 2A carcinogens were evaluated by applying the nine Bradford Hill criteria. Discriminant analysis was used to estimate the weights for each of the nine Bradford Hill criteria. Results: The discriminant analysis yielded weights for the nine causality criteria. These weights were used to combine the nine criteria into one overall assessment of the probability that an association is causal. The criteria strength, consistency of the association and experimental evidence were the three criteria with the largest impact. The model correctly predicted 130 of the 159 (81.8{\%}) agents. Conclusion: The proposed approach enables using the Bradford Hill criteria in a quantitative manner resulting in a probability estimate of the probability that an association is causal. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {We evaluated several lines of evidence to identify bedded fine sediment levels that should protect and maintain self-sustaining populations of native, sediment-sensitive aquatic species in the western US. To identify these potential criterion values for streambed sediments â¤ 0.06 mm (fines) and â¤ 2 mm (sand and fines) diameter, we examined: 1) the range of areal {\%} fines and areal {\%} sand and fines values at 169 least-disturbed reference sites in our sample, 2) sediment tolerance values calculated for a selection of sediment-sensitive aquatic vertebrate and macroinvertebrate taxa for both particle size ranges, 3) quantile regression predictions of the declines in vertebrate and macroinvertebrate Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) at progressively higher ambient levels of streambed sediment from synoptic survey data acquired in 557 mountain stream sampling sites in 12 western states, 4) a literature review of the effects of sand and fines on the survival of salmonid eggs to hatching, and 5) a literature review of studies that quantitatively linked macroinvertebrate response to the pertinent size ranges of streambed sediment in mountain streams. Predicted maximum vertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) declined 4.4 points (SE = 1.0) and macroinvertebrate IBI declined 4.0 points (SE = 0.60) for each 10{\%} increase in {\%} fines. Similarly, for each 10{\%} increase in {\%} sand and fines, the predicted maximum vertebrate IBI decreased 3.7 points (SE = 0.50) and macroinvertebrate IBI decreased 3.0 points (SE = 0.50). Combining all lines of evidence, we concluded that for sediment-sensitive aquatic vertebrates, minimum-effect sediment levels were 5{\%} and 13{\%} for {\%} fines and {\%} sand and fines, respectively, both expressed as areal percentages of the wetted streambed surface. For aquatic macroinvertebrates, minimum-effect levels for the 2 sediment size classes were 3{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively. We encourage managers to consider these biologically based minimum- effect values when developing sediment criteria for mountain streams. Quantifying and comparing both vertebrate and macroinvertebrate assemblage responses to streambed sedimentation informs the criteria- setting process and allows managers to set stream restoration priorities.},

abstract = {This research work adduces new hybrid machine learning ensembles for improving the performance of a computer aided diagnosis system integrated with multimethod assessment process and statistical process control, used for the spine diagnosis based on noninvasive panoramic radiographs. Novel methods are proposed for enhanced accurate classification. All the computations are performed considering steep error tolerance rate with statistical significance level of 5{\%} as well as 1{\%} and established the results with corrected t-tests. The kernel density estimator has been implemented to distinguish the affected patients against healthy ones. A new ensemble consisting of Bayesian network optimized by Tabu search algorithm as a classifier and Haar wavelets as the projection filter is used for relevant feature selection and attribute's ranking. The performance analysis of each method along with major findings is discussed using various evaluation metrics and concludes with propitious results. The results are compared to the existing SINPATCO platform that uses MLP, GRNN, and SVM. The optimization of machine learning algorithms is obtained using Design of Experiments scheme to achieve superior prediction accuracy. The highest classification accuracy obtained is 96.55{\%} with sensitivity, specificity of 0.966 and 0.987 respectively. The objective is to enhance the software reliability and quality of spine disorder diagnosis using medical diagnostic system and reinforce the viability of precise treatment.},

@article{Leigh2013,
abstract = {Worldwide, many rivers cease flow and dry either naturally or owing to human activities such as water extraction. However, even when surface water is absent, diverse assemblages of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the saturated sediments below the river bed (hyporheic zone). In the absence of surface water or flow, biota of this zone may be sampled as an alternative to surface water-based ecological assessments. The potential of hyporheic invertebrates as ecological indicators of river health, however, is largely unexplored. We analysed hyporheic taxa lists from the international literature on temporary rivers to assess compositional similarity among broad-scale regions and sampling conditions, including the presence or absence of surface waters and flow, and the regional effect of hydrological phase (dry channel, non-flowing waters, surface flow) on richness. We hypothesised that if consistent patterns were found, then effects of human disturbances in temporary rivers may be assessable using hyporheic bioindicators. Assemblages differed geographically and by climate, but hydrological phase did not have a strong effect at the global scale. However, hyporheic assemblage composition within regions varied along a gradient of higher richness during wetter phases. This indicates that within geographic regions, hyporheic responses to surface drying are predictable and, by extension, hyporheic invertebrates are potentially useful ecological indicators of temporary river health. With many rivers now experiencing, or predicted to experience, lower flows and longer dry phases owing to climate change, the development of ecological assessment methods specific to flow intermittency is a priority. We advocate expanded monitoring of hyporheic zones in temporary rivers and recommend hyporheic invertebrates as potential bioindicators to complement surface water assessments. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Computer assisted troubleshooting with external interventions is considered. The work is motivated by the task of repairing an automotive vehicle at lowest possible expected cost. The main contribution is a decision theoretic troubleshooting system that is developed to handle external interventions. In particular, practical issues in modeling for troubleshooting are discussed, the troubleshooting system is described, and a method for the efficient probability computations is developed. The troubleshooting systems consists of two parts; a planner that relies on AO search and a diagnoser that utilizes Bayesian networks (BN). The work is based on a case study of an auxiliary braking system of a modern truck. Two main challenges in troubleshooting automotive vehicles are the need for disassembling the vehicle during troubleshooting to access parts to repair, and the difficulty to verify that the vehicle is fault free. These facts lead to that probabilities for faults and for future observations must be computed for a system that has been subject to external interventions that cause changes in the dependency structure. The probability computations are further complicated due to the mixture of instantaneous and non-instantaneous dependencies. To compute the probabilities, we develop a method based on an algorithm, updateBN, that updates a static BN to account for the external interventions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Kumar2012,
abstract = {Sustainability Appraisal (SA) is mandatory under the relevant legislation of UK (DCLG, 2008a) and applies to the preparation of Regional Spatial Strategies, Development Plans and Supplementary Planning documents. SA is a complex task that involves integration of social, environmental and economic considerations into formal plans and often requires trade-offs between multiple stakeholders that may not easily be brought to consensus. Classical assessment can facilitate discussion, but these can only partially inform decision makers as many important aspects of sustainability are abstract and not quantifiable. Such abstract criteria however can be modelled using a Bayesian Network (BN), combining expert opinions, empirical evidence and other information such as model simulation, survey etc. This paper discusses the work of the URSULA project at the University of Sheffield, in which a participative and integrative approach to urban river corridor development, incorporating the principal of sustainability was used. The project used a case study site in Sheffield, UK, and three alternative scenarios were developed, incorporating a number of possible riverside design features. Scenarios were fully designed and visualised using a variety of different media and a sustainability appraisal was undertaken using a broad range of environmental, social and economic indicators. Experts' assessment logics were captured through mind mapping and further expert elicitation was used to develop an integrated model for SA. The BN approach allows model complexity to be reduced to a level appropriate for an assessment process, whilst still taking complex system interactions implicitly into account. The integrated SA model is being used to develop better design by optimising different design elements in order to deliver an optimum (re)-development plan.},

abstract = {Changes to land use affect streams through nutrient enrichment, increased inputs of sediment and, where riparian vegetation has been removed, raised water temperature. We manipulated all three stressors in experimental streamside channels for 30 days and determined the individual and pair-wise combined effects on benthic invertebrate and algal communities and on leaf decay, a measure of ecosystem functioning. We added nutrients (phosphorus+nitrogen; high, intermediate, natural) and/or sediment (grain size 0.2 mm; high, intermediate, natural) to 18 channels supplied with water from a nearby stream. Temperature was increased by 1.4Â°C in half the channels, simulating the loss of upstream and adjacent riparian shade. Sediment affected 93{\%} of all biological response variables (either as an individual effect or via an interaction with another stressor) generally in a negative manner, while nutrient enrichment affected 59{\%} (mostly positive) and raised temperature 59{\%} (mostly positive). More of the algal components of the community responded to stressors acting individually than did invertebrate components, whereas pair-wise stressor interactions were more common in the invertebrate community. Stressors interacted often and in a complex manner, with interactions between sediment and temperature most common. Thus, the negative impact of high sediment on taxon richness of both algae and invertebrates was stronger at raised temperature, further reducing biodiversity. In addition, the decay rate of leaf material (strength loss) accelerated with nutrient enrichment at ambient but not at raised temperature. A key implication of our findings for resource managers is that the removal of riparian shading from streams already subjected to high sediment inputs, or land-use changes that increase erosion or nutrient runoff in a landscape without riparian buffers, may have unexpected effects on stream health. We highlight the likely importance of intact or restored buffer strips, both in reducing sediment input and in maintaining cooler water temperatures.},

@article{Mengshoel2010,
abstract = {One of the main approaches to performing computation in Bayesian networks (BNs) is clique tree clustering and propagation. The clique tree approach consists of propagation in a clique tree compiled from a BN, and while it was introduced in the 1980s, there is still a lack of understanding of how clique tree computation time depends on variations in BN size and structure. In this article, we improve this understanding by developing an approach to characterizing clique tree growth as a function of parameters that can be computed in polynomial time from BNs, specifically: (i) the ratio of the number of a BN's non-root nodes to the number of root nodes, and (ii) the expected number of moral edges in their moral graphs. Analytically, we partition the set of cliques in a clique tree into different sets, and introduce a growth curve for the total size of each set. For the special case of bipartite BNs, there are two sets and two growth curves, a mixed clique growth curve and a root clique growth curve. In experiments, where random bipartite BNs generated using the BPART algorithm are studied, we systematically increase the out-degree of the root nodes in bipartite Bayesian networks, by increasing the number of leaf nodes. Surprisingly, root clique growth is well-approximated by Gompertz growth curves, an S-shaped family of curves that has previously been used to describe growth processes in biology, medicine, and neuroscience. We believe that this research improves the understanding of the scaling behavior of clique tree clustering for a certain class of Bayesian networks; presents an aid for trade-off studies of clique tree clustering using growth curves; and ultimately provides a foundation for benchmarking and developing improved BN inference and machine learning algorithms. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26{\%}), synergistic (36{\%}), and antagonistic (38{\%}). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

abstract = {Ecosystem components interact in complex ways and change over time due to a variety of both internal and external influences (climate change, season cycles, human impacts). Such processes need to be modeled dynamically using appropriate statistical methods for assessing change in network structure. Here we use visualizations and statistical models of network dynamics to understand seasonal changes in the trophic network model described by Baird and Ulanowicz [Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol. Monogr. 501 (59), 329-364] for the Chesapeake Bay (USA). Visualizations of carbon flow networks were created for each season by using a network graphic analysis tool (NETDRAW). The structural relations of the pelagic and benthic compartments (nodes) in each seasonal network were displayed in a two-dimensional space using spring-embedder analyses with nodes color-coded for habitat associations (benthic or pelagic). The most complex network was summer, when pelagic species such as sea nettles, larval fishes, and carnivorous fishes immigrate into Chesapeake Bay and consume prey largely from the plankton and to some extent the benthos. Winter was the simplest of the seasonal networks, and exhibited the highest ascendency, with fewest nodes present and with most of the flows shifting to the benthic bacteria and sediment POC compartments. This shift in system complexity corresponds with a shift from a pelagic- to benthic-dominated system over the seasonal cycle, suggesting that winter is a mostly closed system, relying on internal cycling rather than external input. Network visualization tools are useful in assessing temporal and spatial changes in food web networks, which can be explored for patterns that can be tested using statistical approaches. A simulation-based continuous-time Markov Chain model called SIENA was used to determine the dynamic structural changes in the trophic network across phases of the annual cycle in a statistical as opposed to a visual assessment. There was a significant decrease in outdegree (prey nodes with reduced link density) and an increase in the number of transitive triples (a triad in which i chooses j and h, and j also chooses h, mostly connected via the non-living detritus nodes in position i), suggesting the Chesapeake Bay is a simpler, but structurally more efficient, ecosystem in the winter than in the summer. As in the visual analysis, this shift in system complexity corresponds with a shift from a pelagic to a more benthic-dominated system from summer to winter. Both the SIENA model and the visualization in NETDRAW support the conclusions of Baird and Ulanowicz [Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol. Monogr. 501 (59), 329-364] that there was an increase in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem's ascendancy in the winter. We explain such reduced complexity in winter as a system response to lowered temperature and decreased solar energy input, which causes a decline in the production of new carbon, forcing nodes to go extinct; this causes a change in the structure of the system, making it simpler and more efficient than in summer. It appears that the seasonal dynamics of the trophic structure of Chesapeake Bay can be modeled effectively using the SIENA statistical model for network change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. This paper focuses on the premise that the habitat provides the templet upon which evolution forges characteristic species traits. Alternative hypotheses are that there are historic and phylogenetic constraints on the match between organism and environment. 2. In our analysis of river systems, as one dimension of the templet we choose temporal heterogeneity and assume some relationship between this and the frequency of disturbance. The second dimension is spatial heterogeneity in the physicochemical environment and we pay particular attention to the way such variation can ameliorate the influence of disturbances through the provision of refugia. 3. We derive predictions about the traits of species, including size, generation time, reproductive tactics, body form, mobility and potential for regeneration, that are likely to occur in particular regions of the two-dimensional templet. We also present predictions about community-level characteristics such as number of species per resource category and total species richness. The general predictions are intended to apply to a wide range of plants, micro-organisms and animals, provided the measurements have been made at a scale appropriate to them. 4. Hypotheses can be tested by comparing traits predicted for particular habitats, whose spatial and temporal heterogeneity have been quantified, with those actually observed. If the fit turns out to be good, we will be able to conclude that the habitat templet approach offers a sound framework within which to pose questions in river ecology.},

@article{Crossman2013,
abstract = {Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) plays a key role in eutrophication, a global problem decreasing habitat quality and in-stream biodiversity. Mitigation strategies are required to prevent SRP fluxes from exceeding critical levels, and must be robust in the face of potential changes in climate, land use and a myriad of other influences. To establish the longevity of these strategies it is therefore crucial to consider the sensitivity of catchments to multiple future stressors. This study evaluates how the water quality and hydrology of a major river system in the UK (the River Thames) respond to alterations in climate, land use and water resource allocations, and investigates how these changes impact the relative performance of management strategies over an 80-year period. In the River Thames, the relative contributions of SRP from diffuse and point sources vary seasonally. Diffuse sources of SRP from agriculture dominate during periods of high runoff, and point sources during low flow periods. SRP concentrations rose under any future scenario which either increased a) surface runoff or b) the area of cultivated land. Under these conditions, SRP was sourced from agriculture, and the most effective single mitigation measures were those which addressed diffuse SRP sources. Conversely, where future scenarios reduced flow e.g. during winters of reservoir construction, the significance of point source inputs increased, and mitigation measures addressing these issues became more effective. In catchments with multiple point and diffuse sources of SRP, an all-encompassing effective mitigation approach is difficult to achieve with a single strategy. In order to attain maximum efficiency, multiple strategies might therefore be employed at different times and locations, to target the variable nature of dominant SRP sources and pathways.},

@article{Aristi2012,
abstract = {Mediterranean rivers in the Iberian Peninsula are being increasingly affected by human activities, which threaten their ecological status. A clear picture of how do these multiple stressors affect river ecosystem functioning is still lacking. We addressed this question by measuring a key ecosystem process, namely breakdown of organic matter, at 66 sites distributed across Mediterranean Spain. We performed breakdown experiments by measuring the mass lost by wood sticks for 54 to 106 days. Additionally, we gathered data on physico-chemical, biological and geomorphological characteristics of study sites. Study sites spanned a broad range of environmental characteristics and breakdown rates varied fiftyfold across sites. No clear geographic patterns were found between or within basins. 90th quantile regressions performed to link breakdown rates with environmental characteristics included the following 7 variables in the model, in decreasing order of importance: altitude, water content in phosphorus, catchment area, toxicity, invertebrate-based biotic index, riparian buffer width, and diatom-based quality index. Breakdown rate was systematically low in high-altitude rivers with few human impacts, but showed a high variability in areas affected by human activity. This increase in variability is the result of the influence of multiple stressors acting simultaneously, as some of these can promote whereas others slow down the breakdown of organic matter. Therefore, stick breakdown gives information on the intensity of a key ecosystem process, which would otherwise be very difficult to predict based on environmental variables.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

abstract = {Species composition and abundance of larval insects can vary significantly between similar channel units (riffles) on the same stream as well as between similar streams. The source of this variation is largely unexplained, but important because such spatial variations can influence population and community dynamics and the design of sampling programmes. The maternal and oviposition behaviours of some aquatic insects are specialised, such that eggs are laid in particular locations, and this could influence the spatial distribution of eggs and larvae within a stream. In a relatively short length of stream (1km), we tested whether the number of oviposition sites influenced the number of larvae of different instars in whole riffles that ranged in area from 80 to 460m(2). We examined two species, a mayfly Baetis rhodani and a caddisfly Rhyacophila dorsalis, with larvae that are riffle specialists and adults that oviposit exclusively on emergent rocks in riffles. For comparison, we also examined a control species, blackflies Simulium spp., with larvae that are also riffle specialists, but adults that oviposit on trailing vegetation. As an alternative hypothesis, we tested whether the numbers of larvae per riffle were associated with habitat availability, as measured by riffle area. Numbers of early-instar B.rhodani and R.dorsalis were positively associated with the numbers of oviposition sites per riffle, but not riffle areas. In contrast, numbers of early-instar Simulium per riffle (the control species) were not associated with either predictor variable. For later instars, riffle area was a good predictor of larval numbers per riffle for all species, even though the number of oviposition sites still explained much variation for B.rhodani and R.dorsalis. This ontogenetic shift in distribution patterns suggests an adjustment of densities during larval life, and the evidence points to density-dependent mortality of early-instar larvae. Contrary to the prevailing view that riffle-to-riffle variations in the numbers of aquatic insect larvae can be explained by larval habitat, this study demonstrates a strong influence of adult behaviour, and oviposition site availability can explain significant amounts of this variation for some species. These results challenge traditional views about aquatic insect populations, which may have more complex and interesting dynamics than considered previously.},

A three-layer Diagnostic Bayesian Network (DBN) is developed to diagnose chiller faults based on the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) theory. The structure of the DBN is a graphical and qualitative illustration of the intrinsic causal relationships among causal factors in Layer 1, faults in Layer 2 and fault symptoms in Layer 3. The parameters of the DBN represent the quantitative probabilistic relationships among the three layers. To diagnose chiller faults, posterior probabilities of the faults under observed evidences are calculated based on the probability analysis and the graph theory. Compared with other FDD strategies, the proposed strategy can make use of more useful information of the chiller concerned and expert knowledge. It is effective and efficient in diagnosing faults based on uncertain, incomplete and conflicting information.

abstract = {Nonlinear ecological responses to anthropogenic forcing are common, and in some cases, the ecosystem responds by assuming a new stable state. This article is an overview and serves as the introduction to several articles in this BRIDGES cluster that are directed toward managers interested in dealing with nonlinear responses in freshwaters, particularly streams. A threshold or breakpoint occurs where the system responds rapidly to a relatively small change in a driver. The existence of a threshold can signal a change in system configuration to an alternative stable state, although such a change does not occur with all thresholds. In general, a mechanistic understanding of ecological dynamics is required to predict thresholds, where they will occur, and if they are associated with the occurrence of alternative stable states. Thresholds are difficult to predict, although a variety of univariate methods has been used to indicate thresholds in ecological data. When we applied several methods to one type of response variable, the resulting threshold values varied 3-fold, indicating that more research on detection methods is necessary. Numerous case studies suggest that the threshold concept is important in all ecosystems. Managers should be aware that human actions might result in undesirable rapid changes and potentially an unwanted alternative stable state, and that recovery from that state might require far more resources and time than avoiding entering the state in the first place would have required. Given the difficulties in predicting thresholds and alternative states, the precautionary approach to ecosystem management is probably the most prudent.},

abstract = {A novel real-time reliability evaluation methodology is proposed by combining root cause diagnosis phase based on Bayesian networks (BNs) and reliability evaluation phase based on dynamic BNs (DBNs). The root cause diagnosis phase exactly locates the root cause of a complex mechatronic system failure in real time to increase diagnostic coverage and is performed through backward analysis of BNs. The reliability evaluation phase calculates the real-time reliability of the entire system by forward inference of DBNs. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case of a subsea pipe ram blowout preventer system. The value and the variation trend of real-time system reliability when the faults of components occur are studied; the importance degree sequence of components at different times is also determined using mutual information and belief variance.},

abstract = {Bringing epidemiology and toxicology together to better understand cause and effect relationships requires attention to several interconnected problems: problems of commitment, complexity, and of communication. The most fundamental of these is commitment as it is reflected in the basic purpose of environmental epidemiology. The purpose of epidemiology is not to prove cause-effect relationships, and not only because scientific proof is elusive. The purpose of epidemiology is to acquire knowledge about the determinants and distributions of disease and to apply that knowledge to improve public health. A key problem, therefore, is how much and what kinds of evidence are sufficient to warrant public health (typically preventive) actions? The assessment of available evidence lays the foundation for the problem of complexity: relevant evidence arrives from toxicologic and epidemiological investigations, and reflects the acquisition of knowledge from many levels of scientific understanding: molecular, cellular, tissue, organ systems, complete organisms (man and mouse), relationships between individuals, and on to social and political processes that may impact human health. How to combine evidence from several levels of understanding will require the effective communication of current methodological practices. The practice of causal inference in contemporary environmental epidemiology, for example, relies upon three largely qualitative methods: systematic narrative reviews, criteria-based inference methods, and (increasingly) meta-analysis. These methods are described as they are currently used in practice and several key problems in that practice are highlighted including the relevance to public health practice of toxicological evidence. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a systemic decision approach with step-by-step procedures based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), aiming to provide guidelines for dynamic safety analysis of the tunnel-induced road surface damage over time. The proposed DBN-based approach can accurately illustrate the dynamic and updated feature of geological, design and mechanical variables as the construction progress evolves, in order to overcome deficiencies of traditional fault analysis methods. Adopting the predictive, sensitivity and diagnostic analysis techniques in the DBN inference, this approach is able to perform feed-forward, concurrent and back-forward control respectively on a quantitative basis, and provide real-time support before and after an accident. A case study in relating to dynamic safety analysis in the construction of Wuhan Yangtze Metro Tunnel in China is used to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, as well as its application potential. The relationships between the DBN-based and BN-based approaches are further discussed according to analysis results. The proposed approach can be used as a decision tool to provide support for safety analysis in tunnel construction, and thus increase the likelihood of a successful project in a dynamic project environment.},

abstract = {Few systematic studies of valley-scale geomorphic drivers of streamflow regimes in complex alpine headwaters have compared response between catchments. As a result, little guidance is available for regional-scale hydrological research and monitoring efforts that include assessments of ecosystem function. Physical parameters such as slope, elevation range, drainage area and bedrock geology are often used to stratify differences in streamflow response between sampling sites within an ecoregion. However, these metrics do not take into account geomorphic controls on streamflow specific to glaciated mountain headwaters. The coarse-grained nature of depositional features in alpine catchments suggests that these landforms have little water storage capacity because hillslope runoff moves rapidly just beneath the rock mantle before emerging in fluvial networks. However, recent studies show that a range of depositional features, including talus slopes, protalus ramparts and ârock-ice' features may have more storage capacity than previously thought. To better evaluate potential differences in streamflow response among basins with extensive coarse depositional features and those without, we examined the relationships between streamflow discharge, stable isotopes, water temperature and the amplitude of the diurnal signal at five basin outlets. We also quantified the percentages of colluvial channel length measured along the stepped longitudinal profile. Colluvial channels, characterized by the presence of surficial, coarse-grained depositional features, presented sediment-rich, transport-limited morphologies that appeared to have a cumulative effect on the timing and volume of flow downstream. Measurements taken from colluvial channels flowing through depositional landforms showed median recession constants (Kr) of 0.9â0.95, $\delta$18O values of â¥â14.5 and summer diurnal amplitudes â¤0.8 as compared with more typical surface water recession constant values of 0.7, $\delta$18O â¤ â13.5 and diurnal amplitudes {\textgreater}2.0. Our results demonstrated strong associations between the percentage of colluvial channel length within a catchment and moderated streamflow regimes, water temperatures, diurnal signals and depleted $\delta$18O related to groundwater influx.},

Most studies were of change over short time periods and focused on small spatial scales. Social science studies were dominated by one-off surveys, whereas natural science studies used a diversity of study designs to draw inferences about cause-and-effect. Whilst these differences typically reflect epistemological and methodological traditions, they also imply quite different understandings of resilience.We suggest that there are significant methodological barriers to producing empirical evidence about interactions between complex social and ecological systems.

abstract = {Water managers need quantitative information on the effects of hydrologic alteration on aquatic biota to guide ecologically sensitive water management strategies such as water releases from dams. A key gap in the global research literature is determining whether low levels of hydrologic alteration have significant effects on fish populations and assemblage characteristics. This study quantified patterns of fish response to flow regime alteration in a sub-tropical region where many rivers have regulated flow regimes but 57{\%} of ecologically relevant flow metrics have changed by {\textless}20{\%}. We tested for flow regulation effects on 17 (univariate and multivariate) response variables representing fish population abundance and assemblage characteristics using a field design based on the environmental flow assessment framework known as ELOHA (Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration). Ecological response variables that are readily quantified and sensitive to variation and alteration in flow regimes are critical to the application of environmental flow frameworks such as ELOHA. In this study only three of 17 response variables representing fish population abundance and assemblage attributes showed significant differences between regulated and unregulated reaches (densities of both Pseudomugil signifier and Melanotaenia duboulayi, and fish assemblage composition). Effects associated with flow regulation were most evident where historically intermittent flow regimes have become more perennial as a consequence of managed water releases from dams. Our study provides positive evidence that dams and regulated flow regimes can be managed with sensitivity such that there are few significant changes in populations of most fish species, and little change in fish assemblage characteristics. However, it must be cautioned that the magnitude of flow regime alteration may interact with the duration of exposure (i.e. years to decades) such that other ecological impacts emerge over time as species and assemblages adjust to altered flow regimes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

The aim was to determine the state of research in this area of science, and determine if a review of the literature might permit a gross generalization as to whether the combined effects of multi-stressors and radiation are fundamentally additive, synergistic or antagonistic. A multiple stressor database was established for different organism groups. Information was collected on species, stressors applied and effects evaluated. Studies were mostly laboratory based and investigated two-component mixtures. Interactions declared positive occurred in 58{\%} of the studies, while 26{\%} found negative interactions. Interactions were dependent on dose/concentration, on organism's life stage and exposure time and differed among endpoints. Except for one study, none of the studies predicted combined effects following Concentration Addition or Independent Action, and hence, no justified conclusions can be made about synergism or antagonism. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Public agencies are being asked to quantitatively assess the impact of land management activities on sensitive populations of salmonids. To aid in these assessments, we developed a Bayesian viability assessment procedure (BayVAM) to help characterize land use risks to salmonids in the Pacific Northwest. This procedure incorporates a hybrid approach to viability analysis that blends qualitative, professional judgment with a quantitative model to provide a generalized assessment of risk and uncertainty, The BayVAM procedure relies on three main components: ( 1 ) an assessment survey in which users judge the relative condition of the habitat and estimate survival and reproductive rates for the population in question; (2) a stochastic simulation model that provides a mathematical representation of important demographic and environmental processes; and (3) a probabilistic network that uses the results of the survey to define likely parameter ranges, mimics the stochastic behavior of the simulation model, and produces probability histograms for average population size, minimum population size, and time to extinction. The structure of the probabilistic networks allows partitioning of uncertainty due to ignorance of population parameters from that due to unavoidable environmental variation, Although based on frequency distributions of a formal stochastic model, the probability histograms also can be interpreted as Bayesian probabilities (i.e., the degree of belief about a future event). We argue that the Bayesian interpretation provides a rational framework for approaching viability assessment from a management perspective. The BayVAM procedure offers a promising step toward tools that can be used to generate quantitative risk estimates in a consistent fashion from a mixture of information.},

abstract = {Alterations to the natural flow regime affect the structure and function of rivers and wetlands and contribute to loss of biodiversity worldwide. Although the effects of flow regulation have been relatively well studied, a lack of synthesis of the ecological consequences of low flows and droughts impedes research progress and our grasp of the mechanistic effects of human-induced water reductions on riverine ecosystems. We identified 6 ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow (antecedent conditions, duration, magnitude, timing and seasonality, rate of change, and frequency) that act within the temporal hierarchy of the flow regime and a spatial context. We synthesized the literature to propose 4 principles that outline the mechanistic links between these low-flow attributes and the processes and patterns within riverine ecosystems. First, low flows control the extent of physical aquatic habitat, thereby affecting the composition of biota, trophic structure, and carrying capacity. Second, low flows mediate changes in habitat conditions and water quality, which in turn, drive patterns of distribution and recruitment of biota. Third, low flows affect sources and exchange of material and energy in riverine ecosystems, thereby affecting ecosystem production and biotic composition. Last, low flows restrict connectivity and diversity of habitat, thereby increasing the importance of refugia and driving multiscale patterns in biotic diversity. These principles do not operate in isolation, and many of the ecological pathways that are affected by low flows are likely to overlap or occur simultaneously, potentially resulting in synergistic and complex effects. Last, we outlined major human-induced threats to low-flow hydrology and how they act upon the ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow to affect potential changes in riverine ecosystem integrity. The mechanistic links described in this synthesis can be used to develop and test hypotheses of low-flow hydrologicalâecological response relationships in a causeâeffect framework that will have value for both research and river flow management. Continued experimental research and ongoing consolidation of ecological information will improve our understanding and ability to predict consequences of low-flow alteration on river, floodplain, and estuarine ecosystems.},

The paper focuses on the logical connections among the different types of models and on the different strengths of each approach. Graphical models can illustrate qualitative population assumptions and sources of bias not easily seen with other approaches; sufficient-component cause models can illustrate specific hypotheses about mechanisms of action; and potential-outcome and structural-equations models provide a basis for quantitative analysis of effects. The different approaches provide complementary perspectives, and can be employed together to improve causal interpretations of conventional statistical results.},

We tested this approach in the context of multiple stressors (i.e. chemical and physical) in a selection of six run-of-river reservoirs with different levels of sediment contamination and associated upstream and downstream river sites. A niche-based approach was tested using three functional traits (habitat, food preferences and body size) and discrepancy between the realized and theoretical niches. We first identified three groups of taxa and then recorded differences along the disturbance gradients, such as an increase in competition, a narrowing of spatial and trophic niche breadth (e.g. of Leuctra major and Gammarus pulex), a widening of spatial niche breadth (e.g. of Ephemerella ignita), a greater proportion of small individuals (e.g. of G. pulex) and a decreasing or an increasing (e.g. L. major) discrepancy between realized and theoretical niches.},

abstract = {Forest Analytics with R combines practical, down-to-earth forestry data analysis and solutions to real forest management challenges with state-of-the-art statistical and data-handling functionality. The authors adopt a problem-driven approach, in which statistical and mathematical tools are introduced in the context of the forestry problem that they can help to resolve. All the tools are introduced in the context of real forestry datasets, which provide compelling examples of practical applications. The modeling challenges covered within the book include imputation and interpolation for spatial data, fitting probability density functions to tree measurement data using maximum likelihood, fitting allometric functions using both linear and non-linear least-squares regression, and fitting growth models using both linear and non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The coverage also includes deploying and using forest growth models written in compiled languages, analysis of natural resources and forestry inventory data, and forest estate planning and optimization using linear programming. The book would be ideal for a one-semester class in forest biometrics or applied statistics for natural resources management. The text assumes no programming background, some introductory statistics, and very basic applied mathematics. Andrew Robinson has been associate professor of forest mensuration and forest biometrics at the University of Idaho, and is currently senior lecturer in applied statistics at the University of Melbourne. He received his PhD in forestry from the University of Minnesota. Robinson is author of the popular and freely-available "icebreakeR" document.

@article{Borsuk2004,
abstract = {A Bayesian network consists of a graphical structure and a probabilistic description of the relationships among variables in a system. The graphical structure explicitly represents cause-and-effect assumptions that allow a complex causal chain linking actions to outcomes to be factored into an articulated series of conditional relationships. Each of these relationships can then be independently quantified using a submodel suitable for the type and scale of information available. This approach is particularly useful for ecological modelling because predictable patterns may emerge at a variety of scales, necessitating a multiplicity of model forms. As an example, we describe a Bayesian network integrating models of the various processes involved in eutrophication in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina. These models were developed using a range of methods, including: process-based models statistically fit to long-term monitoring data, Bayesian hierarchical modelling of cross-system data gathered from the literature, multivariate regression modelling of mesocosm experiments, and judgements elicited from scientific experts. The ability of the network to accommodate such a diversity of methods allowed for the prediction of policy-relevant ecosystem attributes not normally included in models of eutrophication. All of the submodels in the network include estimates of predictive uncertainty in the form of probability distributions which are propagated to model endpoints. Predictions expressed as probabilities give stakeholders and decision-makers a realistic appraisal of the chances of achieving desired outcomes under alternative nutrient management strategies. In general, the further down the causal chain a variable was, the greater the predictive uncertainty. This suggests that a compromise is necessary between policy relevance and predictive precision, and that, to select defensible environmental management strategies, public officials must adopt decision-making methods that deal explicitly with scientific uncertainty. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Literature pertaining to sediment in stream ecosystems is reviewed. Suspended sediment can alter the water chemistry, and cause temperature decreases and turbidity increases. Deposition of sediment may change the character of the substrate, block interstices, and reduce interstitial volume. Turbidity levels as low as 5 NTU can decrease primary productivity by 3-13{\%}. An increase of suspended sediment levels increases the drift fauna and may reduce benthic densities as well as alter community structure. Fish are not so obviously affected, although death resulting from clogging of the gills may occur in sensitive species. Suspended and deposited sediment may alter fish community composition, both by interference with nin-riffle-pool sequences and by favouring olfactory feeders over visual feeders. In many situations aesthetic reactions to suspended sediment may be of more concern than biological ones. In already turbid water, a 20-50{\%} reduction in clarity may not be detectable whereas in normally clear water a clarity reduction of 10-15{\%} is distinguishable. Recovery from the effects of suspended sediment and sediment deposition is usually rapid, once the source of contamination is removed and as long as the stream is prone to regular spates; the aesthetic recovery may only take days whereas biological recovery may take months.},

abstract = {Understanding the action of filters on the biological trait composition of communities is constrained by the multitude of filter types (e.g. abiotic vs biotic, actual vs historical) that may cause changes of a multitude of traits (e.g. small vs large body size, short vs long life cycle) at a multitude of spatial scales (e.g. continent vs landscape vs local site). Using published data on the as natural as possible abundances and 11 biological traits (described through 63 categories) of 254 European stream invertebrate genera, we assessed how already available knowledge can serve to identify the importance of the action of different types of trait filters at two spatial scales. Therefore, we analysed observed and simulated abundance-weighted trait compositions at the local scale of 384 running water sites (RWS) and at the landscape scale of 14 large biogeographical regions (LER). Actual abiotic filters acted significantly and independently of the taxonomic richness on the invertebrate traits at the RWS- and LER-scale, whereas biotic filters had no significant effect. Evidence for the action of historical trait filters across Europe was only weak at both scales. Size, reproductive cycle, respiration and locomotion technique, feeding habits and vulnerability to disturbance responded to altitude and stream width of the RWS according to existing views about the effects of riparian, physiological, interstitial or disturbance controls of these traits. These controls acted independently on trait categories that did not co-occur within the genera, because correlations of size categories with other trait categories were higher in the abundance-weighted trait array (across communities) than in the original trait array (across genera). Overall, many of the 63 trait categories were scarcely affected by the trait filters considered in this study. Therefore, we briefly discuss potential effects of continental filters and of stream system-specific, local physical filters, as the latter should produce similar trait patterns on a global scale. Our study suggests that analyses of the currently available knowledge can simplify the complicated hypothetical framework on trait filter actions, which sharpens the focus on future research needs.},

abstract = {Many benthic quality indices rely on categorising impacts by assigning species to ecological-groups (EGs) that reflect their tolerance to pollution. This is usually based on best professional judgement (BPJ) by experts with access to relevant ecological and taxonomic information. However, international applicability of such indices is restricted in areas where the species taxonomy, biology and response to pollution are poorly understood. In this study we describe an approach that enables objective allocation of EGs in situations where species information is limited. This approach utilised BPJ to categorise the environmental condition of benthic habitats around fish farms in New Zealand in relation to defined enrichment stages (ESs). Quantile regression was then used to model distributions of select taxa. The experts assigned ES scores from 1 to 7, for stations that ranged from relatively natural to excessively enriched (i.e. near-azoic), respectively, with judgements based on a suite of quantitative and qualitative indicators of enrichment, but without reference to detailed species information. The individual BPJ estimates were highly correlated, with minimal bias, indicating good agreement among the experts. Forty key indicator taxa were identified and quantile regression models based on ES (derived as a continuous explanatory variable) were fitted for 34. Abundances of the same taxa were also modelled in response to a more traditional enrichment indicator (organic content, {\%}OM) for comparison with the BPJ technique. The regression approach characterised enrichment responses and objectively identified both the upper and lower tolerance limits of a range of taxa according to their ES and {\%}OM. The models discriminated a number of key indicator taxa, including several that were responsive to low-level changes in ES, but not necessarily {\%}OM. There was reasonable agreement (59{\%}) between EGs derived using the regression approach and those defined using the AMBI database (one of the most commonly applied benthic quality indices). Moreover, the regression method allowed the classification of 10 additional taxa for which our ecological understanding was limited. A key outcome of this study was the acknowledgement that EG characterisations for species need to be regionally validated, no matter how well defined they might appear to be. The combined BPJ/regression analysis approach described provides a valid means of both assigning and validating EG classifications, which will be particularly useful in situations where the taxa are poorly defined, and will enable existing biotic indices to be more broadly applied and interpreted. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Pollutant effects on aquatic key species are confounded by multiple abiotic and biotic stressors. To better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, we untangle in present study how the effects of a low-dosed fungicide on daphnids (via different exposure routes) becomes modified by increasing temperature and the presence of a predator. Using a fractional multifactorial test design, the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex were investigated under exposure to the fungicide pyrimethanil at an environmental relevant concentration--either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population)--at three temperatures and in presence/absence of the predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans. Our results clearly illustrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of an aquatic key species to pollutants. The environmentally relevant exposure of the contaminant via food or the medium is of same importance. Nevertheless, temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors controlling the reproduction of D. pulex. We conclude that sublethal pyrimethanil pollution can disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked by low temperatures or if chaoborid larvae are present.},

@article{Campbell2013,
abstract = {1. Both local and regional processes simultaneously control species assemblages depending on spatial habitat configuration. In dendritic networks like streams, the unique spatial arrangement of habitats produces various combinations of local habitat size and isolation. Stream invertebrate assemblages could therefore be controlled by different combinations of local and regional processes, depending on their location in the network. 2. Using quantile regression, we investigated how local habitat size, local environmental conditions and spatial isolation influenced variation in assemblage composition. Adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination scores, as were local environmental conditions, in four headwater stream networks in New Zealand. 3. With increasing local habitat size, there was a decrease in variation in assemblage composition (NMDS scores) of both adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrates. This relationship between habitat size and assemblage variation was related to local habitat conditions at the upper limit of assemblage variability and spatial isolation at the lower limit of assemblage variability, for both adult Trichoptera and benthic assemblages, indicating joint local and regional controls on stream invertebrate assemblages. 4. The relationships between local assemblages and their neighbours, based on community similarity scores, differed between benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Trichoptera. For benthic assemblages, the larger the stream, the more similar assemblages were to neighbouring assemblages, whereas there was no consistent relationship between assemblage similarity and stream size for adult Trichoptera. This difference in structuring could be attributed to contrasting spatial influences linked to the different dispersal modes of adults and larvae. However, because adult and benthic assemblages are not independent, the influence of life stage on spatial distribution is difficult to determine (i.e. it is essentially a âchicken and egg' argument). 5. Overall, our approach using quantile regression to evaluate limit responses, rather than regressions on means, has highlighted the joint importance of local habitat and spatial processes in structuring stream invertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, we have provided evidence for the importance of the spatial network arrangement and interactions between life stages and dispersal processes, in structuring stream assemblages.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Most importantly, interactions among ecological stressors generate nonadditive effects that cannot be easily predicted based on single-stressor studies. Here, we corroborate findings from an in situ mesocosm experiment with evidence from a whole-ecosystem manipulation to demonstrate for the first time that interactions between climate and acidification determine their cumulative impact on the food-web structure of coldwater lakes. Interactions among warming, drought, and acidification, rather than the sum of their individual effects, best explained significant changes in planktonic consumer and producer biomass over a 23-year period. Further, these stressors interactively exerted significant synergistic and antagonistic effects on consumers and producers, respectively. The observed prevalence of long- and short-term ecological surprises involving the cumulative impacts of multiple anthropogenic stressors highlights the high degree of uncertainty surrounding current forecasts of the consequences of global change.},

abstract = {Mindfulness has been suggested to be an important protective factor for emotional health. However, this effect might vary with regard to context. This study applied a novel statistical approach, quantile regression, in order to investigate the relation between trait mindfulness and residual depressive symptoms in individuals with a history of recurrent depression, while taking into account symptom severity and number of episodes as contextual factors. Rather than fitting to a single indicator of central tendency, quantile regression allows exploration of relations across the entire range of the response variable. Analysis of self-report data from 274 participants with a history of three or more previous episodes of depression showed that relatively higher levels of mindfulness were associated with relatively lower levels of residual depressive symptoms. This relationship was most pronounced near the upper end of the response distribution and moderated by the number of previous episodes of depression at the higher quantiles. The findings suggest that with lower levels of mindfulness, residual symptoms are less constrained and more likely to be influenced by other factors. Further, the limiting effect of mindfulness on residual symptoms is most salient in those with higher numbers of episodes.},

The structure of the DBN illustrates qualitatively the casual relationships between faults and symptoms. The parameters of the DBN describe quantitatively the probabilistic dependences between faults and evidence. The inputs of the DBN are the evidences which can be obtained from measurements in building management systems (BMSs) and manual tests. The outputs are the probabilities of faults concerned. Two rules are adopted to isolate the fault on the basis of the fault probabilities to improve the robustness of the method. Compared with conventional rule-based FDD methods, the proposed method can work well with uncertain and incomplete information, because the faults are reported with probabilities rather than in the Boolean format. Evaluations are made on a dynamic simulator of a VAV air-conditioning system serving an office space using TRNSYS. The results show that it can correctly diagnose ten typical VAV terminal faults. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We developed an ontology model based on the terminology used to describe depression and we utilized a Bayesian network to infer the probability of becoming depressed. We also implemented the system using multi-agents to run on the Android platform, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of this method, and we addressed various implementation issues. The results showed that our method may be useful for inferring a diagnosis of depression.},

abstract = {In recent years, the growing interest toward complex critical infrastructures and their interdependencies have solicited new efforts in the area of modeling and analysis of large interdependent systems. Cascading effects are a typical phenomenon of dependencies of components inside a system or among systems. The present paper deals with the modeling of cascading effects in a power grid. In particular, we propose to model such effects in the form of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) which can be derived by means of specific rules, from the power grid structure expressed in terms of series and parallel modules. In contrast with the available techniques, DBN offer a good trade-off between the analytical tractability and the representation of the propagation of the cascading event. A case study taken from the literature, is considered as running example. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Breitburg1999,
abstract = {Aquatic systems are increasingly exposed to multiple stressors from anthropogenic sources. These stressors can vary in the consistency and magnitude of responses they elicit in biota and in how the presence of additional stressors modifies their effects. Understanding how the biological environment and temporal dynamics influence responses to stressors, and how stressors interact, is important to predicting their effects in the natural environment. We examined temporal variability in responses of an experimental estuarine food web to elevated trace elements and nutrients, as well as non-additive effects of the combination of these two stressors. Experiments were conducted four times during spring through autumn 1996 in 20 1-m3 mesocosms. We measured a range of system-, population-, and individual-level parameters to quantify responses of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, copepods, fish, and benthic invertebrates to trace element and nutrient additions. The response to trace element additions was more variable both temporally and among phytoplankton and higher trophic level taxa than was the response to nutrient additions. Most taxa increased, either significantly or showed a trend toward increasing, in response to nutrient additions in all four mesocosm runs. In contrast, the direction as well as the magnitude of responses to trace element additions varied considerably among taxa and experimental runs. Two distinct types of nutrient x trace element interactions were important. First, temporal dynamics of nutrient ratios appeared to affect the temporal pattern of toxicity of trace elements to phytoplankton. Second, in the June mesocosm run when trace element additions reduced production, abundance, or growth of many organisms, these reductions were often proportionately greater in nutrient addition tanks than where no nutrients were added. Our results suggest that considerable temporal and taxonomic variation in responses to trace element loadings are likely to be seen in field settings even under constant loadings to the system and that trace elements may mask the magnitude of the response to high nutrient loadings in eutrophic systems. More generally, the presence of multiple stressors may either increase or dampen the temporal and spatial variability seen in aquatic systems, depending on the interactions among stressors and the influence of background environmental conditions and sensitive species on the expression of stressor effects.},

To explore potential applications of using recycled water for stream enhancement, we examine streams in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, USA, to characterize: (a) historic flow regimes at the regional scale, (b) potential unintended ecological effects and (c) specific issues related to recycled water. We analysed historic flow regimes in five basins, performed a streamflow augmentation experiment and monitored benthic macroinvertebrates above and below a recycled-water discharge. Streamflow augmentation with recycled water can provide improved aesthetics and aquatic habitat, but there are caveats to consider. Implications of inputs of recycled water in streams, whether direct or indirect, require detailed analysis of trade-offs. Augmentation is unlikely to harm the ecology of urban streams that are now just barely flowing perennially with pools of stagnant, contaminated water, and it may reduce public health problems from mosquitoes.},

abstract = {In the past decade, there have been enormous advances in the use of Bayesian methodology for analysis of epidemiologic data, and there are now many practical advantages to the Bayesian approach. Bayesian models can easily accommodate unobserved variables such as an individual's true disease status in the presence of diagnostic error. The use of prior probability distributions represents a powerful mechanism for incorporating information from previous studies and for controlling confounding. Posterior probabilities can be used as easily interpretable alternatives to p values. Recent developments in Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology facilitate the implementation of Bayesian analyses of complex data sets containing missing observations and multidimensional outcomes. Tools are now available that allow epidemiologists to take advantage of this powerful approach to assessment of exposure-disease relations.},

@article{Mesa2006b,
abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18â20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95â99{\%} of their muscle and 73â86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

@article{Hay1994,
abstract = {Many tropical seaweeds and benthic invertebrates produce both secondary metabolites and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles or spicules that serve as possible defenses against consumers. To evaluate the relative defensive value of CaCO3, secondary metabolites, and the potential synergistic or additive effects of the two, we made artificial agar-based ''seaweeds'' in which we manipulated algal organic content, CaCO3, and the secondary metabolites produced by the calcified green seaweeds Rhipocephalus phoenix, Udotea cyathiformis, and Halimeda goreauii, all of which are relatively resistant to herbivores. The effects of these manipulations on herbivore feeding were evaluated using three different types of herbivores, the sea urchin Diadema antillarum, the amphipod Cymadusa filosa, and a mixed-species group of small parrotfishes. Addition of finely powdered CaCO3 as 69$\backslash${\%} of food dry mass had no effect on feeding by parrotfishes, deterred feeding by Cymadusa, and deterred Diadema when food organic content was low but not when it was higher. Although calcification of algal tissues has generally been considered a structural defense that hardens seaweed thalli and makes them more resistant to attack, the decreased feeding on CaCO3-containing foods in our assays occurred without any measurable alteration of food toughness. At natural concentrations, semipurified secondary metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea deterred feeding by all three herbivores. In most assays, feeding was depressed more by the addition of metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea than by the addition of CaCO3 even though CaCO3 was added at 1.3-2.2 times the natural concentration for these plants. In contrast, the major metabolite from Halimeda goreauii, when tested alone, did not affect feeding by any of the herbivores. In two of our nine assays, the synchronous combination of CaCO3 and secondary metabolites acted synergistically and deterred feeding significantly more than the sum of the effects of each tested separately. Mechanisms producing these synergisms are unknown, but it is possible that calcification could also be acting as a chemical defense by altering gut pH in ways that increase the potency of the secondary metabolites. It is common for chemical, structural, morphological, and nutritional deterrents to co-occur in individual prey species. For some plant-herbivore interactions, the combined effects of these characteristics can be much more than the sum of their separate effects.},

@article{Vermaat2015,
abstract = {The success of river restoration was estimated using the ecosystem services approach. In eight pairs of restoredâunrestored reaches and floodplains across Europe, we quantified provisioning (agricultural products, wood, reed for thatching, infiltrated drinking water), regulating (flooding and drainage, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration) and cultural (recreational hunting and fishing, kayaking, biodiversity conservation, appreciation of scenic landscapes) services for separate habitats within each reach, and summed these to annual economic value normalized per reach area. We used locally available data and literature, did surveys among inhabitants and visitors, and used a range of economic methods (market value, shadow price, replacement cost, avoided damage, willingness-to-pay survey, choice experiment) to provide final monetary service estimates. Total ecosystem service value was significantly increased in the restored reaches (difference 1400 Â± 600 â¬ haâ1 yearâ1; 2500 â 1100, p = 0.03, paired t test). Removal of one extreme case did not affect this outcome. We analysed the relation between services delivered and with floodplain and catchment characteristics after reducing these 23 variables to four principal components explaining 80{\%} of the variance. Cultural and regulating services correlated positively with human population density, cattle density and agricultural N surplus in the catchment, but not with the fraction of arable land or forest, floodplain slope, mean river discharge or GDP. Our interpretation is that landscape appreciation and flood risk alleviation are a function of human population density, but not wealth, in areas where dairy farming is the prime form of agriculture.},

abstract = {Interactions between multiple ecosystem stressors are expected to jeopardize biological processes, functions and biodiversity. The scientific community has declared stressor interactionsânotably synergiesâa key issue for con- servation and management. Here, we review ecological literature over the past four decades to evaluate trends in the reporting of ecological inter- actions (synergies, antagonisms and additive effects) and highlight the implications and importance to conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer terminologies, we find that synergies are (still) not the most prevalent type of interaction, and that conservation practitioners need to appreciate and manage for all interaction outcomes, including antagonistic and additive effects. However, it will not be possible to identify the effect of every interaction on every organism's physiology and every ecosystem function because the number of stressors, and their potential interactions, are growing rapidly. Predicting the type of interactions may be possible in the near-future, using meta-analyses, conservation-oriented experiments and adaptive monitoring. Pending a general framework for predicting inter- actions, conservation management should enact interventions that are robust to uncertainty in interaction type and that continue to bolster biological resilience in a stressful world.},

abstract = {Summary 1.Benthic algal communities are shaped by the availability of nutrients and light and by herbivore consumption. Many studies have examined how one of these factors affects algal communities, but studies simultaneously addressing all three are rare. 2.We investigated the effects of nutrients, light and a herbivore (the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum) on benthic stream algae in a fully factorial experiment in 128 circular streamside channels. Four nutrient levels (none added to highly enriched), four snail grazing pressures (no snails to 777Â individualsÂ mâ2) and two light levels (ambient and 65{\%} reduced) were applied. Colonising algae were dominated by diatoms (Bacillariophyta), which were determined to species using acid-cleaned samples and assigned to functional groups according to their physiognomic growth form. 3.Diatom community structure changed considerably in response to our manipulations. Light had the strongest influence (as indicated by manova effect size), whereas nutrients had an intermediate effect and grazing was fairly weak. Relative abundances of six common diatom taxa decreased under reduced light, whereas five others became more prevalent. Eight taxa benefitted from nutrient enrichment, while three became rarer. Grazing affected the relative density of only one common taxon, which increased at higher grazing pressure. 4.Diatom functional groups also responded strongly. âLow profile' taxa dominated at low resource levels (nutrients and especially light), whereas âhigh profile' and âmotile' taxa became markedly more prevalent at higher resource levels. 5.Two-way interactions between experimental factors were quite common. For example, Planothidium lanceolatum and Rossithidium petersenii responded more strongly to nutrient enrichment at reduced than at ambient light, whereas Cocconeis placentula responded more strongly at ambient light. For diatom functional groups, the benefit of nutrient enrichment for âmotile' diatoms was greater at ambient than at reduced light. 6.Our results imply that multifactor experiments are required to determine the main forces driving the composition of benthic algal communities. Further, our findings highlight the considerable potential of using functional algal groups as indicators of changing environmental conditions to complement the traditional taxonomic approach.},

We introduced the new 'CLFI' concept based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network approach and Tree Augmented Na??ve Bayes model.

abstract = {The implementation of an effective control strategy against disease in a finisher herd requires knowledge regarding the disease level in the herd. A Bayesian network was constructed that can estimate risk indexes for three cause-categories of leg disorders in a finisher herd. The cause-categories of leg disorders were divided into infectious causes (arthritis caused by infectious pathogens), physical causes (e.g. fracture and claw lesions), and inherited causes (osteochondrosis). Information about the herd (e.g. the herd size, floor type and number of suppliers) and information about individual pigs (e.g. results from diagnostic tests) were used to estimate the most likely cause of leg disorders at herd level. As information to the model originated from two different levels, we used an object-oriented structure in order to ease the specification of the Bayesian network. Hence, a Herd class and a Pig class comprised the basic components of the object-oriented structure. The causal structure of the model was based on evidence from published literature. The conditional probabilities used in the model were elicited from experts within the field and from the published literature. To illustrate the behaviour of the model, we investigated the value of different levels of evidence in two fictitious herds with different herd characteristics related to the risk of leg disorders (e.g. purchase policy, production type and the stocking density in pens). The model enabled us to demonstrate the value of performing systematic collection of additional information (i.e. clinical, pathological and bacteriological examination) when identifying causes of leg disorders at herd level. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. The catchments of three acidified streams in mid Wales were limed in 1987/88. Here we assess their chemical and biological response in comparison with unmanipulated reference streams over a period of 5 years post-liming. 2. Stream chemistry was measured weekly/fortnightly between 1985 and 1992, while macroinvertebrates were sampled annually. Colonization by acid-sensitive taxa was assessed and trends in community structure were monitored by TWINSPAN. Real biological responses were compared with those predicted by an empirical model constructed using chemical data. 3. There were marked changes in stream chemistry following liming: calcium concentrations and pH values increased, while aluminium concentrations decreased to levels similar to those in naturally circumneutral streams. These conditions have persisted since liming. 4. Empirical models predicted that stream invertebrates would respond to the altered stream chemistry, with the establishment of communities typical of circumneutral conditions. 5. Following liming, the taxon richness and abundance of acid-sensitive taxa was significantly higher in limed compared with reference streams. Colonization by, and persistence of acid-sensitive taxa was patchy, however, and richness was still substantially lower than in naturally circumneutral streams. Moreover, contrary to the model predictions, there were no wholesale changes in the structure of macroinvertebrate communities. 6. We conclude that liming has created and maintained chemical conditions suitable for macroinvertebrate communities typical of circumneutral streams, but these chemical changes have not been matched by sustained responses among the biota.},

abstract = {1. This paper develops a framework of spatial and temporal variability$\backslash$nfor a habitat typology of the Upper Rhone River (France) and its$\backslash$nalluvial floodplain that is based on about 17 years of data collection$\backslash$nand analysis. The aim was to provide a scale of spatial-temporal$\backslash$nvariability for river habitat templet predictions on trends in species$\backslash$ntraits and species richness.$\backslash$n2. In developing this framework, eight physical-chemical variables were$\backslash$navailable and could be considered for twenty-two habitat types:$\backslash$nseventeen superficial (surface) and five interstitial (0.5 m below the$\backslash$nsubstrate surface). These habitat types were selected in two areas (Jons$\backslash$nand Bregnier-Cordon) after geomorphological considerations.and because$\backslash$nof differences in their biological characteristics.$\backslash$n3. The data sets used were processed by a `fuzzy coding' method using,$\backslash$nfor each variable, the frequency distribution (by modalities =$\backslash$ncategories) of all measurements and monthly means over an annual scale.$\backslash$nTwo tables were produced; the first corresponded to an expression of the$\backslash$ntotal variability, and the second represented an evaluation of the$\backslash$ntemporal variability.$\backslash$n4. Each of these tables was analysed by correspondence analysis, which$\backslash$nprovided factorial scores that were used to calculate, by habitat type$\backslash$nand by variable, a total variability and a temporal variability in terms$\backslash$nof cumulated variability of factorial scores for the eight$\backslash$nphysical-chemical variables. The rationale in describing variability$\backslash$nfrom these two tables is that total variability equals temporal$\backslash$nvariability plus spatial variability. The spatial variability was then$\backslash$ndetermined by the difference between total and temporal variability.$\backslash$nFrom this procedure, a positioning of the twenty-two habitat types on$\backslash$nthe spatial and temporal variability axes was obtained.$\backslash$n5. The estimate of spatial variability did not consider any error term$\backslash$nthat may have occurred in the above model; it was then tested by an$\backslash$nindependent assessment of the spatial variability using thirteen$\backslash$nvariables in nine major habitat types. A high correlation between the$\backslash$ntwo ways of assessing spatial variability (r = 0.85, P {\textless} 0.004)$\backslash$nunderscored the reliability of the spatial variability that was$\backslash$ncalculated previously.$\backslash$n6. The river habitat templet obtained for the Upper Rhone and its$\backslash$nalluvial floodplain appears to be appropriate to test the predictions on$\backslash$npatterns of species traits and species richness in the framework of$\backslash$nspatial and temporal variability.},

abstract = {* The factors underlying population and community dynamics are almost invariably multivariate, and ecosystems worldwide are affected by many anthropogenic stressors. Inorganic dissolved nutrients and deposited fine sediment are common stressors in agricultural streams and can be expected to influence benthic algae and cyanobacteria. * We determined population- and community-level responses of phototrophic periphyton along twin-stressor gradients of dissolved nutrients and deposited fine sediment after 20Â days of exposure in stream mesocosms. Multiple linear regression and an information-theoretic approach were used to select the best predictive models for each response variable, accounting for potential subsidy-stress responses for each stressor (where at low stressor levels, an ecological variable responds positively up to an inflection point, beyond which the effect is negative) and for multiple-stressor interactions. This approach enabled us to test the subsidy-stress hypothesis for each stressor and to investigate whether the two stressors operated singly or in concert (additively or with an interaction) on periphyton attributes. * Focussing further on three ecological guilds of periphyton (low profile, high profile, motile), we also tested the specific hypotheses, that sediment augmentation would produce a proportional increase in motile and a decrease in high-profile forms, and that nutrient augmentation would produce proportional increases in both motile and high-profile forms. * Unimodal subsidy-stress patterns along the sediment gradient were found only for densities of two common Nitzschia species. By contrast, unimodal patterns along the nutrient gradient occurred frequently at both population and community levels, supporting the subsidy-stress hypothesis for nutrient enrichment. Some single-stressor responses were observed, but the twin stressors sediment and nutrients mainly acted in a simple, additive way, probably because their modes of action are different. As a notable exception from this rule, potentially harmful cyanobacteria (Phormidium and Oscillatoria species) responded synergistically to the stressors. Our hypothesis about the representation of ecological guilds across the sediment gradient was fully supported, whilst the hypothesis regarding nutrients received partial support. * Categorisation of periphyton taxa into physiognomic guilds revealed predictable response patterns to the stressors. The prevalence of motile taxa in stream communities may be suitable for detecting sedimentation impacts and early signs of nutrient enrichment. Finally, based on periphyton response shapes along the nutrient gradient, thresholds could be identified at which community variables changed abruptly.},

abstract = {Water resource developments alter riverine environments by disrupting longitudinal connectivity, transforming lotic habitats, and modifying in-stream hydraulic conditions. Effective management of anthropogenic disturbances therefore requires an understanding of the range of potential ecosystem effects and the inherent traits symptomatic of elevated vulnerability to disturbance. Using 42 riverine fish native to South Eastern Australia as a case study, we quantified six morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits to classify species into groups reflecting potential differences in their response to ecosystem changes as a result of water resource development. Classification analysis identified five strategies based on fish life-history dispersal requirements, climbing potential, and habitat preference. These strategies in turn highlight the potential species at risk from the separate impacts of water resource development and inform management decisions to mitigate those risks. Swimming ability did not contribute to distinguishing species into functional groups, likely due to methodological inconsistencies in quantifying swimming performance that may ultimately hinder the ability of fish passage facilities to function within the physical capabilities of species at risk of habitat fragmentation. This study improves our ability to predict the performance of groups of species at risk from the multiple environmental changes imposed by humans and goes beyond broad-scale dispersal requirements as a predictor of individual species response.},

Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met. Objective In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review. Method We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The SLR builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012. Results We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice. Conclusion The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. The power of selected biological invertebrate traits for discriminating different types of human impact (heavy metal pollution and cargo-ship traffic) were tested using ecological reasoning and linear Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA).2. Frequency distributions of individual traits and categories of traits from 68 least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) and 304 impacted river reaches were used to define simple assessment rules based on ecological reasoning for specific impairments in large European rivers. In calibration, a maximum of three variables with a priori predictions and two different impairment threshold levels were used. Similarly, DFA was performed on the same variables included in the ecological reasoning approach, but also on all available traits or trait categories.3. Validation with an independent data set (40 LIRRs, 291 variously impacted river reaches) and using the ecological reasoning approach showed that 75â78{\%} of the reaches were correctly assign with rules on all impact types, 35â57{\%} with rules on heavy metal pollution and 78â93{\%} with rules on cargo-ship traffic. By comparison, validation showed that DFA performed globally poorer than the ecological reasoning approach. In addition, the performance of the rules based on ecological reasoning remained stable, whereas DFA performance changed between calibration and validation.4. Although not defined for this purpose, our study provided alarming evidence regarding the impact of cargo-ship traffic on invertebrate communities in river reaches. Reaches with cargo-ship traffic were found to have more genera with long life cycles that reproduce repeatedly by ovoviviparity and have a sessile life.5. The performance of our trait-based approach to correctly assign reaches to either least impacted or impacted conditions should promote further research on the topic across larger geographic areas (without regionalization) and across smaller stream types to provide a powerful biomonitoring tool that fulfils current European Union directives.},

abstract = {1. Using sites from the Upper Rhone River, France, as an example, the objective of this paper is to identify the essential elements needed to test current ecological theories with previously collected data. Procedures developed may enable other groups to design comparable research strategies for syntheses of long-term studies of ecological systems. 2. Because of the high number (more than 200) and turnover of researchers, the long study period (about 17 years), the evolution of research methods and interests, and the diverse systematic groups that were considered (from micro-organisms to birds), the data available for a synthesis were quite heterogeneous. The application of a fuzzy coding' technique allowed such disparate information to be structured for analysis. 3. The habitat templet concept and the patch dynamics concept were selected for analysis with existing data on the Upper Rhone because theories, such as these, that link ecological responses to habitat templets are a focus of current ecological debate and potentially may serve as a general tool for ecologically orientated river management. 4. A preliminary trial to structure the existing knowledge, to identify (and manage) gaps in it, and to create and apply the analytical tools in a way that predictions from theory could be tested was an essential element in the design of this project. 5. Predictions derived from the theoretical concepts had to match the format of the available information on the Upper Rhone; potential bias was avoided by having a priori predictions developed by previously uninvolved colleagues. 6. Synthesis of the long-term study of the Upper Rhone in the context of concurrently developed ecological theory required, at times, an unconventional research strategy. Hence, the generation of hypotheses and methods, the presentation of results, and consequently the discussions in papers of this special issue of Freshwater Biology (Statzner, Resh {\&} Doledec, 1994) represent an innovative approach to testing ecological theory.},

abstract = {This commentary examines an "inconvenient truth" that phosphorus (P)-based nutrient mitigation, long regarded as the key tool in eutrophication management, in many cases has not yet yielded the desired reductions in water quality and nuisance algal growth in rivers and their associated downstream ecosystems. We examine why the water quality and aquatic ecology have not recovered, in some case after two decades or more of reduced P inputs, including (i) legacies of past land-use management, (ii) decoupling of algal growth responses to river P loading in eutrophically impaired rivers; and (iii) recovery trajectories, which may be nonlinear and characterized by thresholds and alternative stable states. It is possible that baselines have shifted and that some disturbed river environments may never return to predisturbance conditions or may require P reductions below those that originally triggered ecological degradation. We discuss the practical implications of setting P-based nutrient criteria to protect and improve river water quality and ecology, drawing on a case study from the Red River Basin in the United States. We conclude that the challenges facing nutrient management and eutrophication control bear the hallmarks of "postnormal" science, where uncertainties are large, management intervention is urgently required, and decision stakes are high. We argue a case for a more holistic approach to eutrophication management that includes more sophisticated regime-based nutrient criteria and considers other nutrient and pollutant controls and river restoration (e.g., physical habitat and functional food web interactions) to promote more resilient water quality and ecosystem functioning along the land-freshwater continuum.},

The aims of this study were to determine: (1) which physico-chemical parameters respond most strongly to agricultural development; (2) how biodiversity, community composition, and food-web structure responded to these changes; and (3) to determine the balance between negative and positive impacts of these subsidies and stresses based on the analysis of 18 headwater streams. Developed pasture streams had increased nutrient loading, alterations to streamside vegetation, increased fine sediment composition, and lower moss coverage of stream- beds than undeveloped or lightly grazed native grassland catchments (which could not be distin- guished from one another). These differences were associated with higher numbers of macroinvertebrate taxa and higher numbers of macroinvertebrates indicating that the net effects of these subsidies and stresses associated with agricultural development were positive within these headwater stream reaches.},

abstract = {The full accomplishment of the European Water Framework Directive objectives has required from EU members three successive steps: (i) the evaluation of their water body ecological status, (ii) the risk assessment of different anthropogenic pressure categories and (iii) the implementation of appropriate management and restoration programs. We aimed at designing an innovative retrospective ecological risk assessment (ERA) tool working for most of the French wadeable rivers in a context of multiple anthropogenic pressures (step ii). This tool, including conditional tree forest (CTF) models, was built on combinations of benthic macroinvertebrate trait-based metrics for each of sixteen anthropogenic pressure categories. For eleven pressure categories, CTF models have given good impairment risk assessment (i.e. AUCâ¥0.70), even at moderate risk level and in a multi-pressure context. The four other models have provided poorer but promising results (AUC=0.67Â±0.02). Identifying the potential weight of individual anthropogenic pressures that lead to biotic assemblage impairment in streams under multiple pressure scenario, is a key step for managers to implement appropriate stream restoration programs. Simultaneously considering the whole complexity of bio-ecological adaptations within biotic assemblages subjected to human pressures provides a functional diagnostic tool both (i) ecologically relevant and (ii) efficient for ERA.},

abstract = {Objective: Interaction terms are often included in regression models to test whether the impact of one variable on the outcome is modified by another variable. However, the interpretation of these models is often not clear. We propose several graphical presentations and corresponding statistical tests alleviating the interpretation of interaction effects. Study Design and Setting: We implemented functions in the statistical program R that can be used on interaction terms in linear, logistic, and Cox Proportional Hazards models. Survival data were simulated to show the functionalities of our proposed graphical visualization methods. Results: The mutual modifying effect of the interaction term is grasped by our presented figures and methods: the combined effect of both continuous variables is shown by a two-dimensional surface mimicking a 3D-Plot. Furthermore, significance regions were calculated for the two variables involved in the interaction term, answering the question for which values of one variable the effect of the other variable significantly differs from zero and vice versa. Conclusion: We propose several graphical visualization methods to ease the interpretation of interaction effects making arbitrary categorizations unnecessary. With these approaches, researchers and clinicians are equipped with the necessary information to assess the clinical relevance and implications of interaction effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {1. Increased fine sediment input caused by agricultural development is expected to act as a stressor for stream ecosystems. In a large-scale field experiment, we added fine river sand to 50-m reaches of three second-order streams in each of four categories of catchment development (ungrazed tussock grasslands, grazed pasture, dairying and deer farming) and measured the responses of macroinvertebrates and aquatic moss. 2. Before addition, fine sediment cover differed between land uses, being lowest in tussock (7{\%}), intermediate in pasture (30{\%}) and dairy (47{\%}) and highest in deer streams (88{\%}). Sediment addition increased cover by one land-use category (e.g. augmented sediment cover in tussock streams was similar to pre-existing cover in pasture streams), and cover remained high in impact reaches (compared with controls) throughout the 5-week experiment. Sediment addition did not change concentrations of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, which were generally highest in dairy streams and lowest in tussock streams. 3. Aquatic mosses (most common in tussock, absent in dairy and deer), invertebrate density (highest in deer, lowest in tussock), taxon richness (highest in pasture, lowest in deer) and diversity (highest in pasture and tussock, lowest in dairy and deer) all differed between land uses. Sediment addition resulted in reductions of moss cover, invertebrate taxon richness and richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera in impact relative to control reaches. 4. The impact of sediment addition was strongest in pasture streams where pre-existing sediment cover was moderate and richness and diversity of the invertebrate community highest. However, even in the already sediment-rich and species-poor deer streams, density of one common taxon was reduced significantly by sediment addition, and another two were affected in the same way in dairy streams, the second-most intense land use. 5. Our experiment has disentangled the impact of sediment addition from other concomitant land-use effects that could not be reliably distinguished in previous research, which has mainly consisted of correlative studies or unrealistically small-scale experiments.},

Linearity may not hold, however, and analyzing the mean of the dependent variable may not capture the full nature of such relationships. Our goal is to demonstrate how combined use of quantile regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) can reveal the true nature and complexity of relationships between continuous variables. Study Design and Setting: We provide a review of methodologic concepts, followed by two examples using real data sets. In the first example, we analyzed the relationship between cognition and disease duration in multiple sclerosis. In the second example, we analyzed the relationship between length of stay (LOS) and severity of illness in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: In both examples, quantile regression showed that the relationship between the variables of interest was heterogeneous. In the second example, RCS uncovered nonlinearity of the relationship between severity of illness and length of stay. Conclusion: Together, quantile regression and RCS are a powerful combination for exploring relationships between continuous variables. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {* The ecological health of rivers worldwide continues to decline despite increasing effort and investment in river science and management. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are increasingly being used as a mechanism for decision-making in river management because they provide a simple visual framework to explore different management scenarios for the multiple stressors that impact rivers. However, most applications of BBN modelling to resource management use expert knowledge and/or limited real data, and fail to accurately assess the ability of the model to make predictions. * We developed a BBN to model ecological condition in a New Zealand river using field/GIS data (from multiple rivers), rather than expert opinion, and assessed its predictive ability on an independent data set. The developed BBN performed moderately better than a number of other modelling techniques (e.g. artificial neural networks, classification trees, random forest, logistic regression), although model construction was more time consuming. Thus, the predictive ability of BBNs is (in this case at least) on a par with other modelling methods but the approach is distinctly better for its ability to visually present the data linkages, issues and potential outcomes of management options in real time. * The BBN suggested management of habitat quality, such as riparian planting, along with the current management focus on limiting nutrient leaching from agricultural land may be most effective in improving ecological condition. * BBNs can be a powerful and accurate method of effectively portraying the multiple interacting drivers of environmental condition in an easily understood manner. However, most BBN applications fail to appropriately test the model fit prior to use. We believe this lack of testing may seriously undermine their long-term effectiveness in resource management and recommend that BBNs should be used in conjunction with some measure of uncertainty about model predictions. We have demonstrated this for a BBN of ecological condition in a New Zealand river, shown that model fit is better than that for other modelling techniques, and that improving habitat would be equally effective to reducing nutrients to improve ecological condition.},

abstract = {An air handling unit's energy usage can vary from the original design as components fail or fault - dampers leak or fail to open/close, valves get stuck, and so on. Such problems do not necessarily result in occupant complaints and, consequently, are not even recognized to have occurred. In spite of recent progress in the research and development of diagnostic solutions for air handling units, there is still a lack of reliable, scalable, and affordable diagnostic solutions for such systems. Modeling limitations, measurement constraints, and the complexity of concurrent faults are the main challenges in air handling unit diagnostics. The focus of this paper is on developing diagnostic algorithms for air handling units that can address such constraints more effectively by systematically employing machine-learning techniques. The proposed algorithms are based on analyzing the observed behavior of the system and comparing it with a set of behavioral patterns generated based on various faulty conditions. We show how such a pattern-matching problem can be formulated as an estimation of the posterior distribution of a Bayesian probabilistic model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by detecting faults in commercial building air handling units. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Scientific and ethical theories are examined in terms of the practice of epidemiology, the study of the determinants and distributions of disease, and the application of the knowledge gained to prevent disease and improve the health of populations. Scientific theories provide explanations and predictions for epidemiologic studies of disease etiology and prevention. Causal theory is the key example for epidemiologic science, although theories of selection processes, theories of health, and theories of probability and statistics are also core. Theories of ethics provide principles, warrants, and methods for acting upon the knowledge gained in the scientific pursuits of epidemiology and for obtaining that knowledge appropriately. Ethical theories guide practitioners in making justified decisions about when and under what conditions public health interventions should be undertaken and how research participants should be treated. Theories of midlevel bioethical principles have received the most attention in epidemiology, but other theories, such as virtue theory and communitarian theory, are also relevant. Many theories matter to the practice of epidemiology: theories of biology, aging, evolution, and medicine; theories of history, religion, law, economics, and politics, as well as the theories of the physical, behavioral, and social sciences. These theories matter because epidemiologists study many different biological and social phenomena, and preventive interventions occur at many different levels of explanation. Development of theory is not a high priority in contemporary epidemiology. Identifying the responsibilities of the discipline to be public health intervention and rigorous science is a first step toward developing and applying theory in epidemiology.},

abstract = {Effective catchment management in the face of landuse alteration depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among varying levels of impact. We compared the efficiency of traditional structural indices of change (species composition) with functional measures based on species traits (including life-history, trophic, and morphological features) in an analysis of grassland streams along a gradient of agricultural development (ungrazed native tussock, grazed tussock, extensively grazed pasture, and intensive dairy and deer farming). Streams were categorized in relation to overall agricultural intensity, and separately in terms of increasing nutrient concentrations and fine sediments on the streambed. Only 5 of 60 individual species demonstrated a significant separation across the landuse gradient, whereas 14 of 53 trait categories did so. Traits associated with population resilience (short generation time, asexual reproduction) became more prevalent with more intense agricultural pressure, reflecting predicted increases in intensity and frequency of stream disturbance. We observed a shift away from a tendency to lay unattached eggs at the water surface of the stream, reflecting the increasing likelihood of smothering by sediment, as well as increases in highly flexible and streamlined body shapes. Principal components and correspondence analyses involving species or trait composition all were able to discriminate landuse practises, but more of the overall between-landuse variance was accounted for by trait composition than species composition. All biological measures (species or trait composition) were correlated with both nutrient concentrations and sedimentation. Nutrient concentrations were better related to species and trait-category densities, whereas sedimentation was related to trait-category relative abundances. Overall, species traits successfully complemented traditional structural measures by helping to differentiate the consequences of landuse intensification in grassland stream communities. Rather than simply recording a loss or reduction of species, our functional approach was able to identify sensitive life-history characteristics linked to the functioning of ecosystems, thereby facilitating the development of targeted management actions. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The North American Benthological Society.},

abstract = {Sedimentation is widely acknowledged as a major cause of degradation of instream habitats. However, macroinvertebrate burial by sediment has been poorly studied. Ex situ experiments were undertaken to examine the response of four common and abundant macroinvertebrate taxa (Baetis rhodani, Nemoura cambrica, Hydropsyche pellucidula, and Asellus aquaticus) to burial by six sediment size classes (range = 125 m â 10 mm in size) and two depths of burial (5 mm and 10 mm). The nymphs of the ephemeropteran, Baetis rhodani, were unable to excavate themselves from any of the sediments. In contrast, the plecopteran nymphs of Nemoura cambrica were able to excavate themselves from all sediment classes and burial depths. Adults of the isopod, Asellus aquaticus, were able to excavate themselves rapidly from finer sediment classes ({\textless} 1 mm) but took significantly longer to escape from sediment {\textgreater} 1 mm in size and became trapped in coarser sediments ({\textgreater}4 mm in size at 5 mm burial depth and {\textgreater} 2 mm at 10 mm burial depth). The larvae of the trichopteran, Hydropsyche pellucidula, were able to excavate their heads from all sediment classes and both burial depths, but became trapped in particles {\textless} 500 m in size when buried under 10 mm of sediment. The results demonstrate that the response of individual taxa to burial with sediments is highly variable. Consequently, many of the documented changes to benthic macroinvertebrate community composition due to sedimentation probably mask a variety of individual faunal responses.},

abstract = {Ecological risk assessment for water environment is significant to water resource management of basin. Effective environmental management and systems restoration such as the Haihe River Basin require holistic understanding of the relative importance of various stressor-related impacts throughout the basin. As an effective technical tool for evaluating the ecological risk, relative risk model (RRM) was applied in regional scale successfully. In this study, the risk transfer from upstream of basin was considered and the RRM was developed through introducing the source-stressor-habitat exposure filter (SSH), the endpoint-habitat exposure filter (EH) and the stressor-endpoint effect filter (SE) to reflect the meaning of exposure and effect more explicit. Water environment which includes water quality, water quantity and aquatic ecosystems was selected as the assessment endpoints. We created a conceptual model which depicting potential and effect pathways from source to stressor to habitat to endpoint. The Haihe River Basin estuary (HRBE) was selected as the model case. The results showed that there were two low risk regions, one medium risk region and two high risk regions in the HRBE. The results also indicated that urbanization was the biggest source, the second was shipping and the third was industry, their risk scores are 5.65, 4.71 and 3.68 respectively. Furthermore, habitat destruction was the largest stressor with the risk scores (2.66), the second was oxygen consuming organic pollutants (1.75) and the third was pathogens (1.75). So these three stressors were the main influencing factors of the ecological pressure in the study area. For habitats, open waters (9.59) and intertidal mudflat were enduring the bigger pressure and should be taken considerable attention. Ecological service values damaged (30.54) and biodiversity decreased were facing the biggest risk pressure.},

abstract = {We developed procedures for using Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model habitat and population viability of selected at-risk fish and wildlife species. The BBN models represent the ecological causal web of key environmental correlates (KECs) that most influence habitat capability, potential population response for each species, and influence of habitat planning alternatives. BBN models represent site-specific KECs, habitat capability at the subwatershed level, and pattern of habitat capability across all subwatersheds. BBNs use Dirichlet prior probability distributions and standard Bayesian updating of posterior probabilities. We derived estimates of prior and conditional probabilities from a mix of empirical data and expert judgment, mostly the latter. Sensitivity analyses identified planning decisions and KECs that most influence species outcomes, and can help prioritize monitoring activities. BBN models, however, substitute for neither field studies nor empirical,quantitative population viability analyses of population demography and genetics.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that epidemiologists should avoid thinking of causes in deterministic terms. This would mean giving up the component-cause model in its original form: a model that has provided important contributions as to how we develop hypotheses, design our study, analyse data, interpret and communicate our results. The component-cause model has considerably more to offer than a simple probabilistic concept. What a causal model has to offer to the advancement of the discipline is equally important as the concept itself. It has been said that we should not hunt "the Holy Grail" (that is, determinism), if it does not exist. This line of reasoning neglects the fact that the "hunting" is more important than the "finding".},

abstract = {System failures, for example in electrical power systems, can have catastrophic impact on human life and high-cost missions. Due to an electrical fire in Swissair flight 111 on September 2, 1998, all 229 passengers and crew on board sadly lost their lives. A battery failure most likely took place on the Mars Global Surveyor, which unfortunately last communicated with Earth and thus ended its mission on November 2, 2006. Fault diagnosis techniques that seek to hinder similar accidents in the future are being developed in this article. We present comprehensive fault diagnosis methods for dynamic and hybrid domains with uncertainty, and validate them using electrical power system data. Our approach relies on the use of Bayesian networks, which model the electrical power system, compiled to arithmetic circuits. We handle in an integrated way varying fault dynamics (both persistent and intermittent faults), fault progression (both abrupt and drift faults), and fault behavior cardinality (both discrete and continuous behaviors). Our work has resulted in a software system for fault diagnosis, ProDiagnose, that has been the top performer in three of the four international diagnostics competitions in which it participated. In this paper we comprehensively present our methods as well as novel and extensive experimental results on data from a NASA electrical power system. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract  The EU Water Framework Directive uses abiotic variables for classifying streams and rivers into types. For rivers, the EU Water Framework Directive fixed typology i.e. âSystem A' typology are defined by ecoregions, size based on the catchment area, catchment geology and altitude. Within any given part of the WFD typology, it is assumed that biological communities at undisturbed sites will be broadly similar and will therefore constitute a type-specific biological target and a way to stratify the spatial variability in stream and river monitoring and assessment. The data collected for the STAR project cover 13 countries and include 22 stream types. A total of 233 sites were fully sampled for all biological quality elements (fish, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms) in the study. Analysing the STAR macroinvertebrate dataset in relation to environmental and biogeographical variables resulted in three major groups of stream types that correspond to three major landscape types in Europe: Mountains, Lowlands and Mediterranean. Similar results were found when analysing all four biological quality elements (fish, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms) sampled in the STAR project. The studies also showed that the stream types using the WFD âSystem A' descriptors are probably less useful at finer scales and it is suggested that a stream typology should take three main parameters as a starting point, i.e., climate (temperature), slope (current velocity) and stream size. Existing site-specific multivariate RIVPACS-type predictive models were also compared to both null models and the WFD âSystem A' physical typology as methods of predicting macroinvertebrate reference conditions. It was concluded that the multivariate models are more effective in predicting reference conditions primarily because they make use of continuous rather than categorical predictor variables and because the multivariate RIVPACS-type models are not constrained by the use of a limited number of variables.},

In each stream, invertebrates were sampled along continuums of deposited sediment (particles {\textless}2 mm in size) from 0 to 100{\%} surface cover in reaches of fairly homogeneous substrate composition, current velocity, and water depths. Correlations, graphical representations, and the cumulative response curves of feeding and habit groups provided strong empirical support for distinct community functional changes due to deposited sediment. Feeding groups were more sensitive to deposited sediment than habit groups. Densities of all the feeding groups decreased significantly with increasing deposited sediment, while relative densities of gatherers increased significantly. Taxa richness also decreased significantly for all the feeding groups except for the shredders. Increases in deposited sediment were related to significant density decreases for only the clingers and sprawlers in the habit group, resulting in significant increases in the relative densities of both burrowers and climbers. Clingers, sprawlers, and swimmers also showed significant decreases in taxa richness.},

The BP neural network is utilized to impute the missing data and the complete data sets are addressed with MLE to obtain the parameters of BN. A method for parameter estimation under incomplete expert knowledge based on BP neural networks and fuzzy set theory is also presented, which is called BP-FS method. Similarly, the missing information is imputed by the trained BP neural network. Fuzzy set theory is employed to quantify the parameters of BN based on complete qualitative expert knowledge. The presented methods are applied to parameter learning of diagnostic BN for a SAHP system with incomplete simulation data and expert knowledge.

abstract = {Global climate change and ozone layer thinning will simultaneously expose organisms to increasingly stressful conditions. Early life stages of marine organisms, particularly eggs and larvae, are considered most vulnerable to environmental extremes. Here, we exposed encapsulated embryos of three common rocky shore gastropods to simultaneous combinations of ecologically realistic levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), water temperature stress and salinity stress to identify potential interactions and associated impacts of climate change. We detected synergistic effects with increases in mortality and retardation in development associated with the most physiologically stressful conditions. The effects of UVR were particularly marked, with mortality increasing up to 12-fold under stressful conditions. Importantly, the complex outcomes observed on applying multiple stressors could not have been predicted from examining environmental variables in isolation. Hence, we are probably dramatically underestimating the ecological impacts of climate change by failing to consider the complex interplay of combinations of environmental variables with organisms.},

We propose that an unbalanced design and substitution of missing data for key parame- ters render their matrix models flawed. They conclude that the main threats to recruitment were lantana and mistletoe invasion and recommend revoking the ban on amla harvest. 3. Our re-analyses of their data set, without substituting unavailable data, showed that cessa- tion of harvests significantly increased stochastic growth rates of amla, despite high lantana and mistletoe cover. 4. Management recommendations by Ticktin et al. (2012) were based on the assumptions of invasiveness of a native mistletoe and grazing impacts of wild ungulates. However, interac- tions with amla are complex, and the recommendations made by them could have deleterious repercussions on native biota. 5. Synthesis and applications. Developing an objective understanding of harvest consequences by incorporating earlier findings and considering uncertainties in results is critical for main- taining livelihoods and ecological processes linked to amla populations.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the application of ecological vulnerability analysis in risk assessment and describes new developments in methodology. For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability.In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results.A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Nancy Cartwright begins her recent book, Hunting Causes and Using Them, by noting that while a few years ago real causal claims were in dispute, nowadays "causality is back, and with a vengeance." In the case of the social sciences, Keith Morrison writes that "Social science asks 'why?'. Detecting causality or its corollary-prediction-is the jewel in the crown of social science research." With respect to the health sciences, Judea Pearl writes that the "research questions that motivate most studies in the health sciences are causal in nature." However, not all data used by people interested in making causal claims come from experiments that use random assignment to control and treatment groups. Indeed, much research in the social and health science depends on non-experimental, observational data. Thus, one of the most important problems in the social and health sciences concerns making warranted causal claims using non-experimental, observational data; viz., "Can observational data be used to make etiological inferences leading to warranted causal claims?" This paper examines one method of warranting causal claims that is especially widespread in epidemiology and the health sciences generally-the use of causal criteria. It is argued that cases of complex causation generally, and redundant causation-both causal overdetermination and causal preemption-specifically, undermine the use of such criteria to warrant causal claims.},

abstract = {The linkage of trait responses to stressor gradients has potential to expand biomonitoring approaches beyond traditional taxonomically based assessments that identify ecological effect to provide a causal diagnosis. Traits-based information may have several advantages over taxonomically based methods. These include providing mechanistic linkages of biotic responses to environmental conditions, consistent descriptors or metrics across broad spatial scales, more seasonal stability compared with taxonomic measures, and seamless integration of traits-based analysis into assessment programs. A traits-based biomonitoring approach does not require a new biomonitoring framework, because contemporary biomonitoring programs gather the basic site-by-species composition matrices required to link community data to the traits database. Impediments to the adoption of traits-based biomonitoring relate to the availability, consistency, and applicability of existing trait data. For example, traits generalizations among taxa across biogeographical regions are rare, and no consensus exists relative to the required taxonomic resolution and methodology for traits assessment. Similarly, we must determine if traits form suites that are related to particular stressor effects, and whether significant variation of traits occurs among allopatric populations. Finally, to realize the potential of traits-based approaches in biomonitoring, a concerted effort to standardize terminology is required, along with the establishment of protocols to ease the sharing and merging of broad, geographical trait information.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides??a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following??a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases.

abstract = {Few systematic studies of valley-scale geomorphic drivers of streamflow regimes in complex alpine headwaters have compared response between catchments. As a result, little guidance is available for regional-scale hydrological research and monitoring efforts that include assessments of ecosystem function. Physical parameters such as slope, elevation range, drainage area and bedrock geology are often used to stratify differences in streamflow response between sampling sites within an ecoregion. However, these metrics do not take into account geomorphic controls on streamflow specific to glaciated mountain headwaters. The coarse-grained nature of depositional features in alpine catchments suggests that these landforms have little water storage capacity because hillslope runoff moves rapidly just beneath the rock mantle before emerging in fluvial networks. However, recent studies show that a range of depositional features, including talus slopes, protalus ramparts and ârock-ice' features may have more storage capacity than previously thought. To better evaluate potential differences in streamflow response among basins with extensive coarse depositional features and those without, we examined the relationships between streamflow discharge, stable isotopes, water temperature and the amplitude of the diurnal signal at five basin outlets. We also quantified the percentages of colluvial channel length measured along the stepped longitudinal profile. Colluvial channels, characterized by the presence of surficial, coarse-grained depositional features, presented sediment-rich, transport-limited morphologies that appeared to have a cumulative effect on the timing and volume of flow downstream. Measurements taken from colluvial channels flowing through depositional landforms showed median recession constants (Kr) of 0.9â0.95, $\delta$18O values of â¥â14.5 and summer diurnal amplitudes â¤0.8 as compared with more typical surface water recession constant values of 0.7, $\delta$18O â¤ â13.5 and diurnal amplitudes {\textgreater}2.0. Our results demonstrated strong associations between the percentage of colluvial channel length within a catchment and moderated streamflow regimes, water temperatures, diurnal signals and depleted $\delta$18O related to groundwater influx.},

abstract = {Concern is growing about the potential effects of interacting multiple stressors, especially as the global climate changes. We provide a comprehensive review of multiple stressor interactions in coral reef ecosystems, which are widely considered to be one of the most sensitive ecosystems to global change. First, we synthesized coral reef studies that examined interactions of two or more stressors, highlighting stressor interactions (where one stressor directly influences another) and potentially synergistic effects on response variables (where two stressors interact to produce an effect that is greater than purely additive). For stressor-stressor interactions, we found 176 studies that examined at least 2 of the 13 stressors of interest. Applying network analysis to analyze relationships between stressors, we found that pathogens were exacerbated by more costressors than any other stressor, with ca. 78{\%} of studies reporting an enhancing effect by another stressor. Sedimentation, storms, and water temperature directly affected the largest number of other stressors. Pathogens, nutrients, and crown-of-thorns starfish were the most-influenced stressors. We found 187 studies that examined the effects of two or more stressors on a third dependent variable. The interaction of irradiance and temperature on corals has been the subject of more research (62 studies, 33{\%} of the total) than any other combination of stressors, with many studies reporting a synergistic effect on coral symbiont photosynthetic performance (n = 19). Second, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature on this most-studied interaction (irradiance and temperature). We found that the mean effect size of combined treatments was statistically indistinguishable from a purely additive interaction, although it should be noted that the sample size was relatively small (n = 26). Overall, although in aggregate a large body of literature examines stressor effects on coral reefs and coral organisms, considerable gaps remain for numerous stressor interactions and effects, and insufficient quantitative evidence exists to suggest that the prevailing type of stressor interaction is synergistic.},

Partly because of this, most environmental management decisions are made using expert opinion. Such decisions can lack transparency. Epidemiologists recognized similar difficulties in ascribing causality in the 1960s, and developed âcausal criteria' to assess causal relations in epidemiological investigations. Causal criteria analysis builds a case for causality based on the cumulative strength of many individually weak pieces of evidence. There have been several calls to use causal criteria analysis in environmental science, but few case studies exist. This may partly result from the lack of standardized methods and analysis tools (analogous to statistical software). We describe the Eco Evidence software package, which has been developed to facilitate causal criteria analysis in environmental science. It employs the published scientific literature as a previously under- used source of evidence for such analyses. The software consists of a web database application â the Eco Evidence Database â for storing and sharing âevidence items' (the information extracted from individual studies necessary for the causal criteria analysis); and a desktop analysis tool â the Eco Evidence Analyser â that uses evidence shared via the web application to assess causal hypotheses. The database provides a permanent, online repository for causal evidence, accessible with any web browser. Moreover, it allows users to access evidence items entered by previous users, thereby reducing the burden of extracting evidence from the literature. The analysis tool uses a wizard-style interface to guide users through an 8-step standardized approach to causal criteria analysis specifically designed for use in the environmental sciences. A full report is produced at the end of the assessment, which contains all the information used to reach the conclusion. This maximizes transparency of the assessment, and means that any bias in the review will be detected more easily compared to a traditional literature review. We demonstrate the Eco Evidence approach with an example that investigates the evidence for the question of whether increased base flows and increased frequency of high flow events can reduce the encroachment of terrestrial vegetation into the channels of regulated rivers. Legislative and social imperatives are prompting a move from an experience-based to an evidence-based model of environmental management. This will lead to more transparent and repeatable decisions, and potentially better decisions overall. However, such a major change of practice will not be easily achieved. Tools such as Eco Evidence will facilitate the transformation by assisting managers to use scientific evidence to inform difficult decisions. With the Eco Evidence software now publicly released and freely available, we are turning our attention to facilitating uptake of the method through promotion and training. We expect that early adopters of Eco Evidence will help to drive rapid evolution of the method and software. However, the current version is already sufficiently well-developed to aid environmental science and management.},

abstract = {We sampled 240 wadeable streams across Wisconsin for different forms of phosphorus and nitrogen, and assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fish to (1) examine how macroinvertebrate and fish measures correlated with the nutrients; (2) quantify relationships between key biological measures and nutrient forms to identify potential threshold levels of nutrients to support nutrient criteria development; and (3) evaluate the importance of nutrients in influencing biological assemblages relative to other physicochemical factors at different spatial scales. Twenty-three of the 35 fish and 18 of the 26 macroinvertebrate measures significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with at least one nutrient measure. Percentages of carnivorous, intolerant, and omnivorous fishes, index of biotic integrity, and salmonid abundance were fish measures correlated with the most nutrient measures and had the highest correlation coefficients. Percentages of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera individuals and taxa, Hilsenhoff biotic index, and mean tolerance value were macroinvertebrate measures that most strongly correlated with the most nutrient measures. Selected biological measures showed clear trends toward degradation as concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen increased, and some measures showed clear thresholds where biological measures changed drastically with small changes in nutrient concentrations. Our selected environmental factors explained 54{\%} of the variation in the fish assemblages. Of this explained variance, 46{\%} was attributed to catchment and instream habitat, 15{\%} to nutrients, 3{\%} to other water quality measures, and 36{\%} to the interactions among all the environmental variables.

@article{Brown2013,
abstract = {Global stressors, including climate change, are a major threat to ecosystems, but they cannot be halted by local actions. Ecosystem management is thus attempting to compensate for the impacts of global stressors by reducing local stressors, such as overfishing. This approach assumes that stressors interact additively or synergistically, whereby the combined effect of two stressors is at least the sum of their isolated effects. It is not clear, however, how management should proceed for antagonistic interactions among stressors, where multiple stressors do not have an additive or greater impact. Research to date has focussed on identifying synergisms among stressors, but antagonisms may be just as common. We examined the effectiveness of management when faced with different types of interactions in two systems--seagrass and fish communities--where the global stressor was climate change but the local stressors were different. When there were synergisms, mitigating local stressors delivered greater gains, whereas when there were antagonisms, management of local stressors was ineffective or even degraded ecosystems. These results suggest that reducing a local stressor can compensate for climate change impacts if there is a synergistic interaction. Conversely, if there is an antagonistic interaction, management of local stressors will have the greatest benefits in areas of refuge from climate change. A balanced research agenda, investigating both antagonistic and synergistic interaction types, is needed to inform management priorities.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) wrapped Bayesian Network (BN) Feature Selection (FS). With this aim, a GA based FS algorithm combined in parallel with a BN classifier is proposed. Basically, erythemato-squamous dataset contains six dermatological diseases defined with 34 features. In GA-BN algorithm, GA makes a heuristic search to find most relevant feature model that increase accuracy of BN algorithm with the use of a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. The subsets of features are sequentially used to identify six dermatological diseases via a BN fitting the corresponding data. The algorithm, in this case, produces 99.20{\%} classification accuracy in the diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases. The strength of feature model generated for BN is furthermore tested with the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Simple Logistics (SL) and Functional Decision Tree (FT). The resultant classification accuracies of algorithms are 98.36{\%}, 97.00{\%}, 98.36{\%} and 97.81{\%} respectively. On the other hand, BN algorithm with classification accuracy of 99.20{\%} is quite a high diagnosis performance for erythemato-squamous diseases. The proposed algorithm makes no more than 3 misclassifications out of 366 instances. Furthermore, FS power of GA is also compared with two alternative search algorithms, i.e. Best First (BF) and Sequential Floating (SF). The obtained results have all together shown that the proposed GA-BN based FS and prediction strategy is very promising in diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The study integrates chemical analyses, a battery of different sediment toxicity tests, and field data from soft-sediment meio- and macrobenthic fauna within a sediment-quality triad in which chironomids, oligochaetes, and nematodes are identified on the species level. The use of TU (toxic units) and msPAF (multi-substance potentially affected fraction) in an approach assessing the chemical impact as well as the integration of sediment toxicity tests with bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), benthic invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus, Chironomus riparius), and fish embryos (Danio rerio), together with univariate and non-parametric multivariate statistical analyses of the biological data revealed significant differences between unpolluted and polluted sites in all three river basins. To combine the different results obtained in the sediment-quality triad, a scoring system was successfully developed based on a simple algorithm. This system provides an easily understandable scheme for non-experts among decision makers and water managers.},

abstract = {Streambed colmation by fine sediment, e.g. the deposition, accumulation and storage of fines in the substrate, is known to have severe effects on invertebrate assemblages in both the benthic and hyporheic zones but the changes in biological attributes of invertebrate assemblages related to colmation have never been considered simultaneously for these two zones. We studied the effects of colmation on the invertebrate assemblages of three rivers, testing a priori hypotheses on the biological attributes that should be more selected in communities subjected to different levels of colmation in both zones. Only the proportion of organisms with high fecundity increased and the proportion of small-sized organisms decreased along the colmation gradient in both zones simultaneously. As expected, a higher number of traits were significantly modified with colmation in the benthic vs. hyporheic assemblages. Most of the biological attributes impaired were different in the two zones. In the benthic zone, colmation mainly selected particular physiological or trophic characteristics of species and features related to their resistance or resilience capacities. In contrast, the morphological attributes of species were much more impaired by colmation in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone. In clogged benthic habitats, traits seemed to be more impaired by an increase in physico-chemical constraints (e.g. the reduction of oxygen availability) and a reduction of potential exchanges (including exchanges of food resources) due to a decline in stream bed conductivity. The morphological attributes of the hyporheic species were probably more influenced by changes in interstitial space characteristics. A potential indicator of the effects of colmation on river health may be based on the functional traits of benthic communities because they (i) satisfy the WFD recommendations, (ii) respond consistently along a colmation gradient and (iii) are comparable among assemblages even across ecoregions that differ in their taxonomic composition. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Community concordance describes similarity in distributions and abundances of organisms from different taxonomic groups across a region of interest, with highly concordant communities assumed to respond similarly to major environmental gradients, including anthropogenic stressors. While few studies have explicitly tested for concordance among stream-dwelling organisms, it frequently is assumed that both macroinvertebrates and fish respond in concert to environmental factors, an assumption that has implications for their management. We investigated concordance among fish and macroinvertebrates from tributaries of two catchments in southeastern Michigan having varied landscape characteristics. Classifications of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages resulted in groups distinguished by differences in taxonomic characteristics, functional traits, and stressor tolerance of their respective dominant taxa. Biological groups were associated with principal landscape gradients of the study region, which ranged from forests and wetlands on coarse surficial geology to agricultural lands on finer, more impervious surficial geology. Measures of stream habitat indicated more stable stream flows and greater heterogeneity of conditions at site groups with catchments comprising forests and wetlands on the coarsest geology, but did not distinguish well among remaining site groups, suggesting that habitat degradation may not be the driving mechanism leading to differences in groups. Despite broadly similar interpretations of relationships of site groups with landscape characteristics for both fish and macroinvertebrates, examination of site representation within groups indicated weak community concordance. Our results suggest that explicit responses of fish and macroinvertebrates to landscape factors vary, due to potential differences in their susceptibility to controls or to differences in the scale at which landscape factors influence these organisms.},

Changes in river discharge act on biota through a hydraulic template which is mediated by channel morphology. Hence environmental flow assessments also need to consider channel morphology, especially if morphology has been altered by human activities. Computer models describing the preferences of fish for hydraulic microhabitats have been applied to environmental flow problems since the mid 1970s. Salmonids have been a particular focus for these methods. Other reviews have provided comprehensive coverage of the basic features and principles of such models. These are briefly discussed before focusing on developments that have occurred in the last 15 years and whose application has so far been infrequent. These include improvements to the representation of hydraulics at reach-scale and of longer river sections, and improved representation of interacting physical variables that describe habitat. The central theme is the spatial coverage and fundamental granularity of such models. Despite a broad literature, there is a lack of documented examples of the application of hydraulic-habitat models through all stages in the environmental flow decision-making process. The review concludes with four short examples which illustrate the use of model output.},

abstract = {Objective: One of the hardest technical tasks in employing Bayesian network models in practice is obtaining their numerical parameters. In the light of this difficulty, a pressing question, one that has immediate implications on the knowledge engineering effort, is whether precision of these parameters is important. In this paper, we address experimentally the question whether medical diagnostic systems based on Bayesian networks are sensitive to precision of their parameters. Methods and materials: The test networks include Hepar II, a sizeable Bayesian network model for diagnosis of liver disorders and six other medical diagnostic networks constructed from medical data sets available through the Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Assuming that the original model parameters are perfectly accurate, we lower systematically their precision by rounding them to progressively courser scales and check the impact of this rounding on the models' accuracy. Results: Our main result, consistent across all tested networks, is that imprecision in numerical parameters has minimal impact on the diagnostic accuracy of models, as long as we avoid zeroes among parameters. Conclusion: The experiments' results provide evidence that as long as we avoid zeroes among model parameters, diagnostic accuracy of Bayesian network models does not suffer from decreased precision of their parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, little is known about the prevalence, spatial patterns, interactions with natural environment and co-occurrence of pressures. This study represents the first high-resolution data analysis of human pressures at the European scale, where important pressure criteria for 9330 sampling sites in 14 European countries were analysed. We identified 15 criteria describing major anthropogenic degradation and combined these into a global pressure index by taking additive effects of multiple pressures into account. Rivers are affected by alterations of water quality (59{\%}), hydrology (41{\%}) and morphology (38{\%}). Connectivity is disrupted at the catchment level in 85{\%} and 35{\%} at the river segment level. Approximately 31{\%} of all sites are affected by one, 29{\%} by two, 28{\%} by three and 12{\%} by four pressure groups; only 21{\%} are unaffected. In total, 47{\%} of the sites are multi-impacted. Approximately 90{\%} of lowland rivers are impacted by a combination of all four pressure groups.},

@article{Resh1994,
abstract = {1. Based on information obtained from analysis of thirteen taxonomic groups of plants and animals occurring in the alluvial floodplain habitats of the Upper Rhone River, France, we synthesize results obtained on: (i) relationships among species traits; (ii) habitat utilization by species; (iii) the relationship between species traits and habitat utilization; (iv) trends in species traits in a framework of spatial and temporal variability; and (v) tests of trends predicted for spedes traits and species richness in the framework of spatial and temporal habitat variability in terms of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concept. 2. Spedes traits describing reproductive characteristics, food, and size had the closest relationships with each other in the various correspondence analyses performed. Faunal and floral separation by spedes traits produced groupings similar to those based on traditional taxonomy. 3. Two major gradients appear in the utilization of the floodplain habitats: a vertical gradient from interstitial to superfidal habitats; and a transverse gradient from the main channel to oxbow lakes, temporary waters, and terrestrialized habitats. 4. For the majority of the groups examined, a statistically significant relationship was evident between the structure of the spedes trait and habitat utilization arrays. For these groups, the characteristics of the habitat act as a tempiet for spedes traits. Moreover, spedes trait modalities (i.e. categories defining traits) were significantly arranged along the axis of spatial and temporal variability for most groups, which indicates that such variability acts as a templet for spedes traits. 5. Spedes traits did not conform to predictions of the river habitat templet because the observed modality sequences did not follow the trends predicted in a framework of spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, there was no clear pattem in the distribution of spedes traits along an axis of temporal variability for groups of organisms having different sizes, which is a correlate of longevity, nor did modalities of species traits that occur under conditions of low temporal variability also tend to occur under conditions of high spatial variability (or vice versa). Clearly, spedes traits occur as altemative suites of characteristics in various groups of organisms. 6. The patch dynamics concept, which predicts that highest spedes richness occurs at intermediate levels of temporal variability and highest levels of spatial variability, was supported by observations in only two of the thirteen groups exaniined, and only partially (for spatial variability) when all 548 taxa were examined together. 7. The predictions of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concepts were not supported, perhaps because templet theories do not yet accommodate alternative suites of characteristics and trade-offs between combinations of traits, or perhaps because the single scale of variability considered in the analyses, the inhomogeneity of the available biological information, and the aggregation of spedes traits that were used created methodological problems. 8. Ecologically sound river management polides eventually may be based on two key points that emerged from this synthesis: that the habitat acts as a templet for spedes traits, and that composite taxonomic groupings represent relatively homogeneous assemblages of spedes trait modalities. 9. The use of statistical approaches developed in this project to analyse other long-term data sets may clarify questions about the applicability of habitat templet theories to river ecology, and hasten development of ecologically sound river management policies.},

This is a distinct disadvantage for those of us who strive to identify the genes involved in complex diseases and quantitative traits. If causation cannot be proven, however, what does constitute sufficient evidence for causation? The philosopher Karl Popper said, "Our belief in a hypothesis can have no stronger basis than our repeated unsuccessful critical attempts to refute it." We believe that to establish causation, as scientists, we must make a serious attempt to refute our own hypotheses and to eliminate all known sources of bias before association becomes causation. In addition, we suggest that investigators must provide sufficient data and evidence of their unsuccessful efforts to find any confounding biases. In this editorial, we discuss what "causation" means in the context of complex diseases and quantitative traits, and we suggest guidelines for steps that may be taken to address possible confounders of association before polymorphisms may be called "causative."},

abstract = {Climate change is reshaping biological communities against a background of existing human pressure. Evaluating the impacts of multiple stressors on community dynamics can be particularly challenging in species-rich ecosystems, such as coral reefs. Here, we investigate whether life-history strategies and cotolerance to different stressors can predict community responses to fishing and temperature-driven bleaching using a 20-year time series of coral assemblages in Kenya. We found that the initial life-history composition of coral taxa largely determined the impacts of bleaching and coral loss. Prior to the 1998 bleaching event, coral assemblages within no-take marine reserves were composed of three distinct life histories - competitive, stress-tolerant and weedy- and exhibited strong declines following bleaching with limited subsequent recovery. In contrast, fished reefs had lower coral cover, fewer genera and were composed of stress-tolerant and weedy corals that were less affected by bleaching over the long term. Despite these general patterns, we found limited evidence for cotolerance as coral genera and life histories were variable in their sensitivities to fishing and bleaching. Overall, fishing and bleaching have reduced coral diversity and led to altered coral communities of 'survivor' species with stress-tolerant and weedy life histories. Our findings are consistent with expectations that climate change interacting with existing human pressure will result in the loss of coral diversity and critical reef habitat.},

abstract = {1. Methods used for the study of species-environment relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for non-symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables, canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which examine species-environment relationships by considering each data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate for fulfilling different objectives, 2. We propose a method, co-inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches encountered in the ecological literature. Co-inertia analysis is based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co-inertia analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem structure. 3. The method was demonstrated using faunistic and environmental data from Friday (Freshwater Biology 18, 87-104, 1987). In this example, non-symmetric analyses is inappropriate because of the large number of variables (species and environmental variables) compared with the small number of samples. 4. Co-inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or between-class and within-class analyses.},

abstract = {Water level management in Mississippi River Pool 25 differentially influences off-channel habitats in the mid-pool and lower pool. Hydrologic models indicate lower pool off-channel habitats dry with greater frequency and duration compared to similar habitats at mid-pool. We examined the influence of this contrasting hydrology on substrate characteristics, organic matter, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities in off-channel habitats during 2001--2003. Benthic organic matter standing stocks were stable in mid-pool habitats but lower pool values were variable because of annual differences in moist-soil vegetation production. Generally, small-bodied and multivoltine invertebrate taxa had high community biomass and dominated lower pool habitats, whereas longer-lived and large-bodied taxa were more abundant and had higher community biomass in mid-pool habitats having longer hydroperiods. Fish communities were dominated by cyprinids in both habitats, and mid-pool habitats tended to be higher in overall species richness. Unique fish taxa were collected in each pool, with primarily rheophilic forms in mid-pool habitats and limnophilic forms in lower pool habitats. Results indicate that contrasting hydrology associated with a mid-pool control point directly and indirectly influences biological communities in off-channel habitats. Further, management regimes that promote hydrologic diversity in off-channel habitats may enhance biological diversity at larger spatial and temporal scales.},

Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

abstract = {There is an ongoing debate regarding how and when an agent's or determinant's impact can be interpreted as causation with respect to some target disease. The so-called criteria of causation, originating from the seminal work of Sir Austin Bradford Hill and Mervyn Susser, are often schematically applied disregarding the fact that they were meant neither as criteria nor as a checklist for attributing to a hazard the potential of disease causation. Furthermore, there is a tendency to misinterpret the lack of evidence for causation as evidence for lack of a causal relation. There are no criteria in the strict sense for the assessment of evidence concerning an agent's or determinant's propensity to cause a disease, nor are there criteria to dismiss the notion of causation. Rather, there is a discursive process of conjecture and refutation. In this commentary, I propose a dialogue approach for the assessment of an agent or determinant. Starting from epidemiologic evidence, four issues need to be addressed: temporal relation, association, environmental equivalence, and population equivalence. If there are no valid counterarguments, a factor is attributed the potential of disease causation. More often than not, there will be insufficient evidence from epidemiologic studies. In these cases, other evidence can be used instead that increases or decreases confidence in a factor being causally related to a disease. Even though every verdict of causation is provisional, action must not be postponed until better evidence is available if our present knowledge appears to demand immediate measures for health protection.},

abstract = {1. Social network analyses tend to focus on human interactions. However, there is a burgeoning interest in applying graph theory to ecological data from animal populations. Here we show how radio-tracking and capture-mark-recapture data collated from wild rodent populations can be used to generate contact networks. 2. Both radio-tracking and capture-mark-recapture were undertaken simultaneously. Contact networks were derived and the following statistics estimated: mean-contact rate, edge distribution, connectance and centrality. 3. Capture-mark-recapture networks produced more informative and complete networks when the rodent density was high and radio-tracking produced more informative networks when the density was low. Different data collection methods provide more data when certain ecological characteristics of the population prevail. 4. Both sets of data produced networks with comparable edge (contact) distributions that were best described by a negative binomial distribution. Connectance and closeness were statistically different between the two data sets. Only betweenness was comparable. The differences between the networks have important consequences for the transmission of infectious diseases. Care should be taken when extrapolating social networks to transmission networks for inferring disease dynamics.},

@article{Bonada2007,
abstract = {Streams in mediterranean regions have highly seasonal discharge patterns, with predictable torrential floods and severe droughts. In contrast, discharge is less variable in temperate regions and intermittent flow conditions are uncommon. Hydroclimatic models predict that climate change would increase frequency and severity of floods and droughts across Europe, thus increasing the proportion of streams with mediterranean characteristics in actually temperate areas. Correspondingly, understanding actual ecological differences between mediterranean and temperate streams may help to anticipate large-scale ecological impacts of climate change. Given that large-scale factors determine local community composition, we hypothesized that climatic differences between mediterranean and temperate regions should affect the taxonomic and biological trait composition in streams. We assembled the abundance of stream macroinvertebrate genera of 265 sites each from the Mediterranean Basin and from temperate Europe and linked these abundances to published information on 61 categories of 11 biological traits reflecting the potential of resilience from and resistance to disturbances. Although regional taxonomic richness was higher in the mediterranean than in the temperate region, local taxonomic richness and diversity did not significantly differ between regions. Local trait richness and diversity were significantly higher in the mediterranean region. Both local taxonomic and trait-community composition differed between regions, but the former varied much more than the latter, highlighting that climate change could produce large changes in the taxonomic but rather weak changes in the trait composition. The mediterranean region was characterized by macroinvertebrates with higher dispersion and colonization capabilities, suggesting that species loss in the temperate region, by extinction or northward emigration of taxa, would be compensated for by immigration of southern mediterranean taxa. Thus, climate change would likely have stronger implications for the local conservation of taxa than for the trait composition of stream macroinvertebrate communities.},

@article{Nakagawa2007,
abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

Frequency distributions of bounded outcomes are often unimodal, U-shaped, and J-shaped. To the best of our knowledge, in the biomedical and epidemiological literature bounded outcomes have seldom been analyzed by appropriate methods that, for one, correctly constrain inference to lie within the feasible range of values. In many respects, continuous bounded outcomes can be likened to probabilities or propensities. Yet, what has long been heeded when modeling the probability of binary outcomes with the widespread use of logistic and probit regression, so far appears to have been overlooked with continuous bounded outcomes with consequences at times disastrous. Logistic quantile regression constitutes an effective method to fill this gap.},

abstract = {Valid causal inference is central to progress in theoretical and applied psychology. Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.},

abstract = {Economic growth is often based on the intensification of crop production, energy consumption and urbanization. In many cases, this leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Modelling water resources and the related identification of key drivers of change are essential to improve and protect water quality in river basins. This study evaluates the potential of Bayesian belief network models to predict the ecological water quality in a typical multifunctional and tropical river basin. Field data, expert knowledge and literature data were used to develop a set of Bayesian belief network models. The developed models were evaluated based on weighted Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa${\textless}inf{\textgreater}w{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI) and spherical payoff. On top, a sensitivity analysis and practical simulation tests of the two most reliable models were performed. Cross-validation based on $\kappa${\textless}inf{\textgreater}w{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (Model 1: 0.44Â±0.08; Model 2: 0.44Â±0.11) and CCI (Model 1: 36.3Â±2.3; Model 2: 41.6Â±2.3) indicated that the performance was reliable and stable. Model 1 comprised of input variables main land use, elevation, sediment type, chlorophyll, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand; whereas Model 2 did not include dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand. Although the predictive performance of Model 2 was slightly higher than that of Model 1, simulation outcomes of Model 1 were more coherent. Additionally, more management options could be evaluated with Model 1. As the model's ability to simulate management outcomes is of utmost importance in model selection, Model 1 is recommended as a tool to support decision-making in river management. Model predictions and sensitivity analysis indicated that flow velocity is the major variable determining ecological water quality and suggested that construction of additional dams and water abstraction within the basin would have an adverse effect on water quality. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the modelling approach can be of general use on any other river basin.},
